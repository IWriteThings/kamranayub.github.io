Today I was excited to give a talk at [Midwest.js](http://midwestjs.com) about [Demystifying TypeScript](http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript). This is not the first time I've given the talk, it's actually the **fourth** time. Instead of leaving it stale I revamped the theme and updated all the information to be current as of today--including information about [Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

Unfortunately due to technical difficulties (no HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter!) the talk's *video* wasn't recorded. However, I was mic'd and I did use SnagIt to record my screen, so we're hoping we can merge the audio and video tracks to generate a recording. If not, I may need to sit down and record audio for the talk.

I will update this post after the conference and let you know the status--let's hope we can get it working! Otherwise, I guess you just had to be there ;)

If you attended and have questions, feel free to leave them here or [tweet](http://twitter.com/kamranayub) at me!
