Another year has passed and it's time to take a look back and see what I accomplished!

## Open Source

It's been a busy year in open source for me with over 1100+ contributions, let's see...

![2016 contributions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/21598070/22a0d308-d11b-11e6-8c8a-2eeef49ae568.png)

- [**excalibur.js**](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur): Excalibur remains one of the largest OSS projects I help maintain. I redesigned the [Excalibur.js website](http://excaliburjs.com). I made
about [49 pull requests](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Akamranayub)
to the codebase. We made 4 releases, bringing us from 0.6 to 0.8 (over 177 issues closed!).
- [**TypeDoc**](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc): This was a close one, last month I [submitted a PR](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/pull/365) to support TypeScript 2.1.4.
- [**DefinitelyTyped**](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/): Made [my first PR](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/13169) to DefinitelyTyped even though I've made tons of private declaration files for my projects.
- [**UnderscoreKO**](https://github.com/kamranayub/UnderscoreKO): Updated for Underscore 1.8
- [**PoshOpenWeatherMap**](https://github.com/kamranayub/posh-openweathermap): I made a fun little weather Powershell module.
- [**cassette-sri**](https://github.com/kamranayub/cassette-sri): I needed [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) support for KTOMG, so I published an extension to Cassette.

## New Tech

I definitely enjoy learning new things and playing with tech.

- Played with [Azure Key Vault](http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/02/24/azure-key-vault-config-encryption-azure/)
- Dabbled in some [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/eonarheim/aspnet-core-demogame)
- At work I dove deep into Powershell DSC and JFrog Artifactory
- I set up equipment for my course recording: [Behringer XENYX Q802USB Mixer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008O517IC), [ATR2100 Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100-USB-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B004QJOZS4)
- I got a Raspberry Pi 3 for Christmas and made it into an emulation console using [Lakka](http://lakka.tv)

## Gaming

Making and playing games remains one of my passions, that much is clear:

- [**Keep Track of My Games**](http://ktomg.com): I [released 10 updates](http://blog.keeptrackofmygames.com/tagged/updates) to KTOMG last year, some of the biggest ones so far, adding tons of major new features.
- I [participated](http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/05/08/ludum-dare-35-game-jam/) in the Ludum Dare 35 game jam with the game [Hex Shaper](http://excaliburjs.com/ludum-35/).
- Me and [Erik Onarheim](http://erikonarheim.com) made a [ASP.NET Core demo game](http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/07/31/aspnet-core-demo-game/) for a work code camp
- We also made a [Planet Wars AI simulator](http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/01/25/planet-wars-ai-competition-excaliburjs-csharp/) in Excalibur for a work competition
- I've been working on a (currently private) sample game for Excalibur, it will be used as a the primary learning sample for new users.
- I [played some games](https://keeptrackofmygames.com/users/kamranicus/lists/Playing)

## Speaking & Conferences

I gave some talks and went to conferences! I spread the TypeScript love.

- [**Midwest.js**](http://midwestjs.com/): I gave a presentation on [Demystifying TypeScript](http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript/#/) at Midwest.js in August this year. It was a lot of fun,
but the recording still isn't up on YouTube yet.
- [**TCCC20**](http://twincitiescodecamp.com): I gave a presentation on [TypeScript in Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeh-FcC6Sew) at Twin Cities Code Camp 20 in April.
- [**MS Build**](http://build.microsoft.com): I [attended](http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/03/11/attending-build-2016/) Microsoft Build 2016 with my coworkers. It was a blast.

## Publishing

I want to try and commit to beating 2016's blog post count:

- I [published 16 blog posts](http://kamranicus.com/blog/archives/) in 2016.
- I [accepted a contract](http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/10/30/new-packt-publishing-typescript-course/) to make an Introduction to TypeScript video course with Packt Publishing.

## Life

- My wife and I are expecting our first child in February! I'm sure this will definitely affect how much time I get to spend on side projects so developing some kind of rhythm will be key.

I'm sure there's other stuff I'm forgetting--but I'm super proud of all the stuff I got done this year. Here's looking forward
to 2017 as a new father!
