Yesterday I released my [.JSON](http://github.com/kamranayub/.JSON) library as a NuGet package (about time). It is named **DotJson.Source** to follow current conventions. If you need me to, I can also release it as a compiled DLL.

You can get it via Visual Studio or the [Nuget.org](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/DotJson.Source) page.

## To Use It

Add it as a library reference via Nuget. In your code file, you can add a `using DotJson;` and then start using the library. That's all you have to do.

See the [documentation wiki](http://github.com/kamranayub/.JSON/wiki) for more information.
