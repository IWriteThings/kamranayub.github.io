HoloLens has the potential to change how we live, drastically.

<!-- More -->

[Microsoft Build](http://buildwindows.com/) is Microsoft's annual developer conference. I attended the conference in 2013 and 2014 for work and had a blast both times. This year I couldn't attend since we have been living in France (a good excuse) but I still wanted to catch the livestream of this year's keynote. 

Since we were in Bordeaux during the keynote, I was watching the livestream while sipping on some cheap red wine (no worries, it was night and we were done for the day).

I was getting pretty excited as things progressed. [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) was pretty awesome, [adding websites to the Windows Store](http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/windows-10-will-introduce-web-apps-store) was pretty awesome (especially for [Keep Track of My Games](http://keeptrackofmygames.com)), but more than any of that, the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us) announcement and demos **blew my mind**. 

If you haven't seen the HoloLens demo from the keynote, it starts around 2:48:30:

Is your mind sufficiently blown? Mine was too. It was [indistinguishable from magic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws) (as it *is* sufficiently advanced).

All at once, like a tidal wave unannounced, a whole slew of ideas ran through my head on what kinds of possibilities could be made possible with HoloLens. Some of them assume certain functionality or environment conditions are there, but there's no use dreaming if you can't dream a little bit ahead of the curve, right?

After the keynote, I was excited but we had to find a place to eat. We settled on Santosha, a local Thai place where all the young "hip" French people go. During dinner that night, Cassie and I discussed tons of cool uses for Lens and though my lovely wife isn't a developer nor a self-identified "techie", I could see her excitement as she thought of things that would be cool and we both exchanged ideas.

I kept having ideas afterward too. Too many! As a mental excercise and to ensure the ideas go down somewhere, I decided I'd write a post about it. So here goes: **101 Ideas for the Microsoft HoloLens**. Ideas are cheap, so I'm sharing them. Probably, like many ideas, some of these are trash. Others are promising. Others probably are not possible with the current HoloLens technology. Still others may inspire **you** with an idea. Whatever came out of my head, I wrote it down and made no priority or judgement calls.

## I want a HoloLens

Basically if you can't tell, I would like to be wearing HoloLens **all the time** (in fact, for many of these ideas, you'd have to for them to be practical). 

There are literally infinite uses for this technology, as virtual space is infinite, the Earth is a large place and we do a lot of things we need help with. I find HoloLens even more compelling than the Oculus Rift because HoloLens doesn't [necessarily] replace the world; it just augments it&mdash;which makes it much more manageable to be wearing all the time. 

Let's say in 10-20 years, the technology progresses enough that it can be miniaturized in a contact lens or even glasses (with your prescription). We'd all be equipped with a Lens and we'd all have shared/private holograph experiences. Would that ever happen? Glasses seems doable. If it's as easy as what I do with my current prescription glasses and it's fashionable, I'm sold. As for everyone having one? There are more phones than people in this world and that's happened relatively fast (for humans). Anything is possible. All you need is a killer app.
