I just released my second Windows Phone app, [Bowling Calculator][1]. It's an [open source app][2] that I created when [I gave my talk at TCCC15][3].
If you're a fellow developer, feel free to send me a pull request with any bug fixes or enhancements. I want to keep it focused on
the simple use case of scoring a bowling game; I don't need it to track multiple games or keep track of history. It's purpose is to serve
as a production-ready sample app and to also be good at what it aims to do.
