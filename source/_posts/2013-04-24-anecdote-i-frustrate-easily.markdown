When I first started my "real job" where I'm at I was put on an internal site. It was a beast, it had a lot of history, and more importantly, it was **damn ugly and sometimes hard to use**. The site was used by developers and no one on the team had much UI experience. I was frustrated. I couldn't work on this thing and have it be ugly, why should we have a tool that gets used every day that's a bear to use? "Because it's always been that way" wasn't good enough for me. For about a month I worked outside of work, off the sprint, and I re-tooled the CSS, markup, and UX while still maintaining the overall functionality and behavior. No one asked, I just did it **because I was frustrated.** Sure, at some points, people were sort of wondering what the heck I was doing but in the end, everyone loved the changes and everyone keeps mentioning how great the changes have been since. I believe it was also the start of a bigger push to make things easy to use internally but I suppose correlation does not equal causation :)

I think that's what [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) means when he says to [hire people who frustrate easily](https://speakerdeck.com/holman/keeping-people?slide=31) and that's what triggered this anecdote.
