There are at least a couple app contests I know of for Windows 8: [Apptivate](http://apptivate.ms) and [GenerationApp](http://www.generationapp.com/giveaway/).

The prizes are cool and all you need to do is make an app. In fact, for Apptivate at least, *your app doesn't even need to be complete to win*!

Can't think of an app to make? No worries, just ask yourself: what site do you like and would you like to bring it to Windows 8 or WinRT? Then ask, does it have an API or feed or enough of *something* to make a usable app? If the answer is **Yes** to both of those questions, you have your app.
