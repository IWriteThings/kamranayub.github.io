You may have remembered me saying in the last few posts I've been working on v2 of [KTOMG](http://keeptrackofmygames.com). It's going well and progress is being made. I also recently acquired a Windows Phone for agreeing to release an app before June. Funnily enough, I learned from Jeff Brand today while at [Twin Cities Code Camp](http://twincitiescodecamp.com) that there will be some accelerator labs in May that will provide a way to quickly get up and running on Windows 8. Needless to say, I decided that it would be good to target both platforms, which means I have even more work to do in the next couple months (like I need more?).

This is pretty exciting. I have big plans for KTOMG and I really hope it pans out. The plan is to release v2 on 3 platforms and to be on the Windows 8 app store on day one. It will be technically interesting to see how separation of the codebase will be done on all three of these different platforms. For WP7, I'm sure I'll need to write a XAML front-end but with Windows 8, I can probably reuse most of my existing web code. It'll also be interesting to take advantage of each platform's unique abilities (push notifications, camera, etc.).

Bring it on!
