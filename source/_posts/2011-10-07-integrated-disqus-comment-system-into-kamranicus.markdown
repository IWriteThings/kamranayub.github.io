When I wrote Kamranicus, I wanted a simple blog where I could use Markdown and copy/paste images. I achieved that but I also built a simple comment system.

While fun and a good exercise in using OpenID, I should have thought to check if there is any universal comment system available. There is. It's called [Disqus](http://disqus.com). Unfortunately, I discovered it after I made Kamranicus.

As you can see now, Disqus is now the comment backend for Kamranicus' posts. Now I can allow anyone to comment using whatever provider they want, moderate comments, have comment threads, trackbacks, and loads of other useful features.

It was easy to integrate. Check it out if you are in the same situation as me.
