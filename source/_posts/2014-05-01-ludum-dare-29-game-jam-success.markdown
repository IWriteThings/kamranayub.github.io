This last weekend I spent 72 hours working on a game for the [Ludum Dare 29][1] game jam. LD is a competition where you get a prompt for a game and then have to spend 48 hours (solo) or 72 hours (jam) and bang out a game. The solo competition has strict rules but the game jam has looser rules and allows for team development. It was a caffeine-filled rush and I hope to write a blog post shortly about how it all went down. It was a ton of fun! I worked with my friends [Erik Onarheim][2] and [Josh Edeen][3], both primary contributors to the [Excalibur.js][4] game engine. I am also a contributor but I haven't done a ton with the engine core, moreso the usability of the API, opening GH issues, and the [website][5].

In the meantime, be sure to check out the fruits of our labor! It's a game where you play as the Kraken and you destroy ships. We originally had a ton of ideas, as you can see in our GitHub repository, but with only 72 hours your scope is pretty narrow. Still, we're very happy with what came out and we're glad that [Excalibur.js][4] pulled through!

Play [Kraken Unchained][6]. Vote for it on the [LD site][9]. You can also take a peek at the [post-LD][7] version which is in on-going development. It does support touch and fixes some issues in IE10/11.

You can also view the entirety of the source code [on GitHub][8]!
