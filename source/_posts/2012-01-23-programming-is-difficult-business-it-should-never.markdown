> "Programming is difficult business. It should never be undertaken in ignorance." - *Javascript: The Good Parts*, Douglas Crockford

What a great quote to program by.

I've been undertaking a pet project (a *game*, no less) that's forced me to brush up on my Javascriptings. I would highly recommend this book if you also want to get your hands dirty with Javascript.

Oh, my game? Yah, I can't talk about it yet. I've never made a game before (but I've always wanted to) and I think I've finally come up with something I could possibly do (i.e. not 3D, not requiring 25 art designers, and not in a language I don't know). We'll see how it goes and I'll let you know.
