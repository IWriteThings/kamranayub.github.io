It's talk time again! I'm lucky to be giving yet another talk at Twin Cities Code Camp (my second one!). Last time was a lot of fun! This time, we're [leaving the Web API pasture](/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp) and exploring the fun world of Windows Phone development.

TCCC15 is October 19 and I'll be [speaking in Rapson 45 at 2:15pm](http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Schedule.aspx), so come say hi!

## Why You Should Attend

If you're an experienced or even a beginning Windows Phone developer, come. If you're still not sure why Windows Phone is cool, come.

The code I'll be showing will start out at a beginner level and move all the way passed intermediate to advanced. By the end, for example, you'll see how to implement a custom message box that fully supports Caliburn binding, dismissal, and the view lifecycle.

Finally, all the code will be available on GitHub soon after (this weekend?). I just need time to remove any secrets and figure out a license that will let me publish the app and own it while still allowing you all to learn from it.

## What We'll Talk About

I'll be doing a "live coding" presentation. In reality, I'll be coding and switching to Git branches that showcase the fully completed code then walk through it. The app I'll be presenting is actually a "complete" app; meaning that it works fine and does everything I need it to. However, anyone whose done app development can tell you that the work isn't done when your app runs and all your tests pass; there's still plenty of work making it "production ready." That's what I'll cover in my session!

Right now, my talk is divided into 5 sections covering MVVM, fast resume, logging, about page, and UX improvement. The sections are designed in a way that will expose you to many different parts of my preferred MVVM framework, Caliburn. Along the way, you'll also learn some great tips & tricks I've found along my journey designing Windows Phone apps.

I'm excited because we'll start with the basic premise of an app (which works) and then take it to a production-ready application. Literally, **by the end of the presentation**, I could publish my app to the store and feel good about it.

I hope to see you on Saturday!
