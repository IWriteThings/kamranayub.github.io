A team member posed a question to the rest of us at work about how we keep up with changes in the web/.NET arena. For me, it was a simple answer, **follow people that are smarter than me.**

Personally, I think you can not only learn a lot about best practices by following people who are smart but also keep up with new technology and practices. I also think it helps you get more involved because usually, these people provide thought-provoking posts and raise interesting questions or issues.

Case in point: I had never heard of **BackboneJS** and **CoffeeScript** until a few weeks ago because someone I followed wrote about them. I now have learned both through tutorials and screencasts (that I bought) and they are my new favorite client-side tools. Sometimes I hear about stuff but don't realize its full value until someone points it out, like **SASS** or **HTML 5 Boilerplate.**

## So who's smart?

I tend to follow .NET developers, "big" names although whenever they mention someone *they* follow, I do as well. Here's my current list and I'll try to keep this up-to-date:

* Phil Haack - .NET developer and lead on ASP.NET MVC
* Scott Hanselman - .NET guru and all-around swell guy
* Scott Gu - .NET guru
* Paul Irish - HTML 5 Boilerplate creator
* Dave Ward - .NET developer
* Rob Conery - .NET/Ruby developer and sometimes non-traditional (which is good)
* Ayende Rahien - NHibernate creator
* Jeff Atwood - StackOverflow
* Steve Sanderson
