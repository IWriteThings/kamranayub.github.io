Just a quick set of FYIs. I will be attending 3 upcoming events, two in-person and one virtually.

### RWD Workshop with Tim Kadlec

[Tim Kadlec](http://timkadlec.com) is a cool guy; he's also one of the RWD gurus and has lots to share. He's [hosting a 30 person workshop](http://timkadlec.com/2013/04/implementing-responsive-design-workshop/) at the U of MN, so it'll be a small group of people that will be sharing RWD experiences. I'm attending, and if prodded, I will share my experience implementing RWD on some big sites (hint: it's challenging).

### Code Camp

[Twin Cities Code Camp](http://twincitiescodecamp.com) is a free conference put together by local volunteers and is a great event to go to if you like to see people's code or share your own. I will be [talking about Web API](/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp) and opening up my closed-source project (Keep Track of My Games v2) for all to see. It's going to be interesting, for sure.

### dotNetConf

[dotNetConf](http://dotnetconf.net) is a free virtual conference on all things .NET. I'll be attending a couple sessions at least and there's nothing to lose by attending. Be sure to check it out!

### Hack for MN

[HackForMN](http://hackformn.eventbrite.com/) is for the National Day of Civic Hacking but for us Minnesotans. A handful of friends are going and I think there's probably a good app or two for The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes worth making.
