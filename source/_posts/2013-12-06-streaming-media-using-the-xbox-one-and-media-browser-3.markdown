I got my Xbox One on Day One. I was really excited. After having used it for awhile now, I'm very pleased with the experience. We've used Skype to talk to distant friends and we've snapped Netflix to the side when playing games. It's awesome.

If you came from a 360 or even a PS3, you probably used the great streaming feature to browse your networked PC's music, movies, and videos. We use it all the time to stream movies and TV shows from the PC to the 360 or even the PS3.

If you tried doing that with the Xbox One, you probably found out the hard way that **this is just not supported anymore**. It boggles the mind, one can only hope Microsoft will release an Xbox App that will act as a media center. To be clear, you *can* "play to" the Xbox One from a Windows 8 PC, but this is useless because typically you're sitting on your couch *not on your computer* and wanting to stream a movie or video or TV show (that you legitimately own).

Well, all is not lost. Let me tell you about Media Browser 3!

## What is Media Browser 3?

MediaBrowser3 is a free media server you install on your PC. It provides an awesome website that lets you view, manage, and **stream** from anywhere. You could even allow the Media Server Browser port to be exposed externally and use password-protected accounts to let you stream remotely. There's even a client for Windows Phone.

Basically, what we're going to do is use the Xbox's excellent IE11 browser to browse our Media Browser server and play our media!
