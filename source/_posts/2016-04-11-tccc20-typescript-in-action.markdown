I'll be speaking at 8:30am this weekend at [Twin Cities Code Camp](http://twincitiescodecamp.com). My talk will about using TypeScript
in the context of an Angular 2 ASP.NET MVC web application but will focus on how TypeScript enhances my productivity and showcases some features of the language. I've done the talk previously internally at General Mills and had a great response so I thought I'd piggyback on the success of my previous [Demystifying TypeScript](http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript/#/) talk (which is also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb7tvaBJeMs)).

If you're at all interested in seeing how TypeScript development looks in action, you should attend and I'd recommend going through my
previous talk if you're still not convinced TypeScript is awesome. This talk assumes you are at least open to the idea of developing
in TypeScript and are curious to see how it can be used.

It'll be a fun time and a busy weekend--I'll have to leave the conference right after my talk to participate in Ludum Dare, where I'll
be helping to build a game in 72 hours. I'm sad I'll miss the speaker happy hour and the prizes but it's for a good reason! 
Hope to see you Saturday!
