I just released [Have I Been Pwned?](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/have-i-been-pwned/43ca9526-4db2-40ba-9125-60d7abe62b40) to the Windows Phone store. It's a tiny, tiny app that only took me a couple hours to build. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/kamranayub/HaveIBeenPwned).

[HaveIBeenPwned.com](http://haveibeenpwned.com) is a website created by [Troy Hunt](http://www.troyhunt.com/), a security MVP, that checks to see if your email address appears in a database of all the breached email addresses in prominent hacks like Gawker, Sony, and Adobe. I've definitely been pwned, so it's a good service to use to quickly see if you need to change your passwords.

I plan to add the background task soon but I wanted the initial release out there so that I can just submit updates to it. If you want to contribute, send me a pull request!
