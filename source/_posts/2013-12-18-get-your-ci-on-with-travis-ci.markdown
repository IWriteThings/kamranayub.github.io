I just published an article on Tech.pro that [walks through getting started with Travis CI](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1749/get-your-ci-on-with-travis-ci). We use it for Excalibur.js and that was my first
time configuring it, so I thought I might as well write up a nice tutorial for other people. It's really an awesome service, especially
for open source projects.
