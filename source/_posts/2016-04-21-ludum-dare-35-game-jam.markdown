This last weekend I took part in the global Ludum Dare 35 game jam. If you've been following me for awhile, you know I've participated in the past too. This time we made a game called Hexshaper--where the goal is to seal portals to another dimension to prevent monsters from overtaking the world. The backstory, while not communicated directly, informed our design--a witch is trying to brew some kind of crazy potion but accidentally combines everything together causing inter-dimensional portals to open up and spew forth annoying baddies. Using your "aura" or "Hex" (a shield), you absorb their magic to seal the portals. If you manage to survive the third wave, you win!

It's interesting to look at where the game was 24 hours into the competition because **it looks nothing like the final theme**:

A ship shooting bullets at vampire bats in space? That is *nothing* like a witch flying around inside a castle closing portals! How did that come to be?
