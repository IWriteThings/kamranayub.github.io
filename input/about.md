Title: About
---

My name is Kamran Ayub. I'm a professional developer and technologist that based in Minneapolis, MN
and have been in the industry since 2006. I've worked in multiple Fortune 500 companies
working on small to massive scale consumer-facing and line of business web applications.

I am a full-stack developer which means I am at home at the command-line, building `flexbox` UIs,
in Illustrator, and SSH'd into a Docker container (just kidding, don't do that). I specialize
in web application design and architecture with C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS. 
UX is a tenant in all that I do in both UI and API design. Bad design frustrates me.

Since frameworks come and go, you can see a more complete picture of my current skills and
specialties on my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/subkamran). I'm comfortable working
on Linux, Mac or PC--I run cross-platform.

In my spare time, I run the website [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com),
I contribute to [Excalibur.js](http://excaliburjs.com), and [many other small projects](http://github.com/kamranayub).

*After* my spare time is used up, I [make](/projects) and 
[play](https://keeptrackofmygames.com/user/kamranicus) video games, and participate in game jams. [The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind](https://keeptrackofmygames.com/users/kamranicus/lists/favorites) is my favorite game.

Oh, I also love to [travel](/travel).

## Teaching & Speaking

I am a Pluralsight and Packt course author, you can view my current courses on the [projects](/projects) page or follow my [Pluralsight author profile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/kamran-ayub). I really enjoy teaching and sharing what I know and authoring courses is definitely something I intend to pursue.

I also [speak](/events) at user groups and conferences, as well as host workshops. 

## Keep Track of My Games

[Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) is a way to organize your game collection and track new
releases. I started it in 2011 and have been running it solo ever since. The application is non-commercial
because I leverage the GiantBomb game database for my data. In order to keep the site up-to-date and fast,
I have background jobs that utilize an on-prem version of the Azure Kudu console along with Azure 
Queues and Table Storage. The tech stack is ASP.NET MVC, TypeScript, and RavenDB as the backend database.

## Excalibur.js

[Excalibur.js](http://excaliburjs.com) is a web-based game engine written in TypeScript. I work with
several other talented friends on the project. The project is free and open source. We leverage heavy
automation using services like Travis CI, Appveyor, and Coveralls. The API documentation is generated
using TypeDoc and we've set up cross-repository automation to ensure the docs are 100% up-to-date with
the master branch. We use the typical GitHub Pull Request workflow to perform code reviews and ensure
that the master branch stays green and stable.
