I'm having a tough time coming to terms with what I'm about to write--but I'm honored that my scalable React and TypeScript talk has been accepted for [NDC Minnesota](http://ndcminnesota.com)!

[NDC is a big deal](https://ndcminnesota.com/page/about-ndc) and I will be sharing the spotlight with such ubiquitous experts like K. Scott Allen & Michelle Bustamante, both of whom are giving workshops I can't decide between, Steve Sanderson, Brock Allen, and *more*. OK OK sure, it's not NDC London or NDC Sydney--but it's **still** NDC and I **still** can't believe I was accepted. This is also a huge personal milestone as this will be my first conference that isn't just local.

## About the talk

If you don't really follow me and are wondering what the talk will be about, well, [you can watch it online](https://youtu.be/owcuEwn-pSM) (spoiler alert!). But I promise it's going to be different and better, somehow. In fact, my React rewrite might *actually* be done by then!

## I. am. terrified.

Followed closely behind my excitement is a looming wave of terror--as I will need to refine, revamp, and level up my talk for a bigger audience. I've done it twice (once at Midwest.js and once within Target) and now I pray the third time will be a homerun.

## 2018 is starting strong

As far as [my goals](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2018-01-01-2018-a-new-year) for the year go, I think I have a good start. I've [got a workshop](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-12-18-workshop-bots-javascript-node-minnewebcon) lined up for May as well, [my Pluralsight course](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-10-10-becoming-a-pluralsight-author) is almost ready, and now I'm speaking at NDC. I've also been nominated for a Microsoft MVP (oops, did I not mention that... shh, the two of you who read this keep it down). We also just bought a house. And it's only January.
