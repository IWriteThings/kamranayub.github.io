I gave my [Building Scalable, Maintainable Apps with TypeScript & React][talk] talk (video soon) at NDC this last week and it was a blast. Had some really great conversations afterwards and feedback was positive, which is what any speaker can hope for. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wish I could have stayed and come! Loved your talk about react/typescript.</p>&mdash; Phill Stewart (@HeWhoFreeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeWhoFreeks/status/994710519364931584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

Thanks Phill! This kind of feedback makes all the stress, planning, and nerve-wracking-ness about giving talks totally worth it. I guarantee every small bit of praise you give to a speaker, online or in-person, is very much appreciated.

I'm always a little cautious before this talk since it assumes some prior knowledge of TypeScript or React but I had folks come up to me and even though they hadn't had as much experience, it sparked them to learn more--which is *also* what any speaker can hope for. Value can be provided to any skill level I think, whether it's from "Should I even learn this? Will it help me?" to "I've done this for a year but I haven't seen that pattern before," which was my goal.

Back when I proposed my first course for Pluralsight I had pitched a TypeScript and React course but it was turned down since the curriculum has a lot of React and TypeScript courses *separately*. I may still pitch it again because [there's still no one course that ties them together][search] (or with Flow, for that matter). I had a good conversation with a gentleman about how there's not *that* many resources out there on specifically patterns around TS and React, a primary motivation for this talk. There's certainly enough content for a 2-3 hour course and there's a specific course pattern called a [playbook][playbook] that this may fit.

Another person I spoke to suggested I pitch the talk to JSMN and speaking at meetups is [on my 2018 goals list][goals] so **of course** I will do that. They also let me know about the [Midwest Gaming Classic][classic] which would be cool to bring some [Excalibur](http://excaliburjs.com) talks to or just attend in general.

By the way, a friendly reminder I'll be talking about Node.js bots [at the Minneapolis Azure meetup][meetup] in September!

There were so many other great talks I went to, I will post a follow-up soon hopefully with links to the recordings if they're out by then.
