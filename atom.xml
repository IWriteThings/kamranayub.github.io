    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have an urge to write a quick list of tips for improving an ASP.NET MVC application because
I just got done reviewing some code for a support ticket at work. It&rsquo;s still fresh
in my mind and I wanted to get some of my thoughts down to share with others. If you
have been doing MVC for a while, I don&rsquo;t think much of this is news. It&rsquo;s more
for those of you that don&rsquo;t do MVC often or are new to MVC.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Imagine this: you&rsquo;ve been tasked to figure out why a web application is using 2GB of memory on the
production web servers. You pull down the version that&rsquo;s currently in production and run it locally
to profile and debug.</p>

<p>After looking through the code, doing some profiling, maybe shaking your head a bit, you&rsquo;ve figured
out what the issue is and now you need to give some feedback.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me today and out of that experience, 5 tips you can follow to keep
your ASP.NET MVC codebase working as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<h3>1. Understand the queries in your problem domain</h3>

<p>The root cause of the support ticket I received was a simple case of fetching too much
data from the database, causing obscene amounts of memory usage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a common enough issue. You&rsquo;re building a simple blog, it has posts and it has media (images, videos, attachments).
You put a Media array onto your Post domain object. Your Media domain object has all the image
data stored in a byte array. Since you&rsquo;re using an ORM, there&rsquo;s a certain way you need to design your domain model
to play nice; we&rsquo;ve all experienced this.</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s nothing absolutely wrong with this design. You&rsquo;ve modeled your domain accurately. The problem is, when you
issue a query through your favorite ORM, it eagerly loads all the data associated with your blog post:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">_db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">BlogPosts</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">OrderByDescending</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PostDate</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">Take</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">take</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">ToList</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A seemingly innocuous line (unless you&rsquo;ve been bitten), a sneaky monster is lying in wait with big consequences if you haven&rsquo;t disabled
lazy loading or didn&rsquo;t tell your ORM to ignore that big <code>Data</code> property on blog media.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand how your ORM queries and maps objects and make sure you only query what you need (for example using projection).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">IList</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">PostSummary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">GetNewestPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">take</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">_db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">BlogPosts</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">OrderByDescending</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PostDate</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">Take</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">take</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">Select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">PostSummary</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">Title</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Title</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">Id</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Id</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}).</span><span class="n">ToList</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This ensures we only grab the amount of data we really need for the task. If all you&rsquo;re doing is using the title and ID to build a link on the homepage, <em>just ask</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to have more than 5 methods on a repository; be as granular as you need to be for your UI.</p>

<h3>2. Don&rsquo;t call your repositories from your views</h3>

<p>This one&rsquo;s a little sneaky. Consider this line in an MVC view:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="n">@foreach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">RelatedPosts</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It <em>seems</em> innocent enough. But if we take a look at what exactly that model property is hiding:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyViewModel</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">IList</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">BlogPost</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">RelatedPosts</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">get</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">BlogRepository</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">GetRelatedPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Tags</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yikes! Your &ldquo;view model&rdquo; has business logic in it on top of calling a data access method directly. Now you&rsquo;ve introduced data
access code somewhere it doesn&rsquo;t belong and hidden it inside a property. Move that into the controller so you can wrangle it in
and populate the view model conciously.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to point out that implementing proper unit tests would uncover issues like this; because you definitely can&rsquo;t intercept calls to something like that and then you&rsquo;d realize injecting a repository into a view model is probably not something you want to be doing.</p>

<h3>3. Use partials and child actions to your advantage</h3>

<p>If you need to perform business logic in a view, that should be a sign you need to revisit your view model and logic.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s advisable to do this in your MVC Razor view:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="err">@</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">blogController</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">BlogController</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">@foreach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">tag</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">blogController</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetTagsForPost</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Id</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="n">@tag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Putting business logic in the view is a no-no, but on top of that you&rsquo;re creating a <em>controller</em>! Move that into your action method and use
that view model you made for what it&rsquo;s intended for. You can also move that logic into a separate action method that only gets called inside views
so you can cache it separately if needed.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="c1">//In the controller:</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="na">[ChildActionOnly]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="na">[OutputCache(Duration=2000)]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">TagsForPost</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">postId</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">View</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//In the view:</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">@</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">Html</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">RenderAction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;TagsForPost&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">postId</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Id</span> <span class="p">});}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice the <code>ChildActionOnly</code> attribute. From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.childactiononlyattribute(v=vs.118).aspx">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any method that is marked with <code>ChildActionOnlyAttribute</code> can be called only with the <code>Action</code> or <code>RenderAction</code> HTML extension methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means people can&rsquo;t see your child action by manipulating the URL (if you&rsquo;re using the default route).</p>

<p>Partial views and child actions are useful tools in the MVC arsenal; use them to your advantage!</p>

<h3>4. Cache what matters</h3>

<p>Given the code smells above, what do you think will happen if you only cached your view model?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">Index</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">homepageViewModel</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">HttpContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Cache</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;homepageModel&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">HomepageViewModel</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">homepageViewModel</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">homepageViewModel</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HomepageViewModel</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">homepageViewModel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">RecentPosts</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">_blogRepository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetNewestPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">HttpContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Current</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Cache</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;homepageModel&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">homepageViewModel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">View</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">homepageViewModel</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nothing! There will not be any performance gain because you&rsquo;re accessing the data layer through a controller variable in the view and
through a property in the view model&hellip; caching the view model won&rsquo;t help anything.</p>

<p>Instead, consider caching the <em>output</em> of the MVC action instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="na">[OutputCache(Duration=2000)]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">Index</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">homepageViewModel</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HomepageViewModel</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">homepageViewModel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">RecentPosts</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">_blogRepository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetNewestPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">View</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">homepageViewModel</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice the handy <code>OutputCache</code> attribute. MVC supports ASP.NET Output Caching; use it to your advantage when it applies. If you are
going to cache the model, your model needs to essentially be a POCO with automatic (and read-only) properties&hellip; not something that calls other
repository methods.</p>

<p>As an added benefit, I haven&rsquo;t ever done this but you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg650661.aspx">implement different output caching providers</a> allowing you to cache on
AppFabric/NoSQL/anywhere if you ever needed it. MVC is super extensible.</p>

<h3>5. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to leverage your ORM</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not going to take advantage of your ORM&rsquo;s feature set, you are missing out. In the codebase
I was reviewing, they were using NHibernate but they weren&rsquo;t <em>using</em> it. They were totally missing out on <a href="http://nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html#querycriteria-projection">its advanced projection
capabilities</a> to solve some of these memory issues. Some of this stems from rigidity in using a &ldquo;repository pattern&rdquo; and some of it stems from lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of EF or NHibernate&rsquo;s features, your repositories can do a lot more than just use basic generic methods. They can shape and
return the data <em>you actually want</em> in your controllers, greatly simplifying your controller logic. Do yourself a favor and read through the ORM&rsquo;s documentation to get a handle on what it can offer.</p>

<p>I think when people adopt the repository pattern, it&rsquo;s almost like they pull down a shade over the bright light shining in from their ORM window. When I started playing with RavenDB, I <strong>got rid</strong> of my repository layer (in fact, my <em>entire data project</em>) and went full-metal using Raven queries in my application service layer with a little bit of extension methods to reuse query logic. I found that <em>a lot</em> of my logic was really context-specific and benefited from simply taking advantage of Raven&rsquo;s extensive features to project, shape, and batch my queries.</p>

<h4>That&rsquo;s just, like, your opinion man&hellip;</h4>

<p>If you think you can abstract your ORM, I challenge you to think about it differently. The ORM <em>is</em> your abstraction and if you believe swapping out your existing ORM with another ORM will be a piece of cake because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;abstracted&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d be surprised. That&rsquo;s what I thought too until I learned the hard way that switching to Raven really changed my entire codebase in ways I didn&rsquo;t expect. Your ORM doesn&rsquo;t only affect data access, it affects the domain and it affects your business logic, it even will have an effect on your UI. By removing the repository abstraction, I actually <em>reduced the overall complexity</em> of my data access code.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Common sense is not so common&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Or so my dad loves to remind me at times. Sometimes it just takes a good code review to remind oneself that what you thought everyone knew isn&rsquo;t the case; you probably learned it through experience or frantic Googling and just assumed other people already knew it.</p>

<p>I hope this helped someone else out!</p>

<p>I just released <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/have-i-been-pwned/43ca9526-4db2-40ba-9125-60d7abe62b40">Have I Been Pwned?</a> to the Windows Phone store. It&rsquo;s a tiny, tiny app that only took me a couple hours to build. You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/HaveIBeenPwned">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a> is a website created by <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a>, a security MVP, that checks to see if your email address appears in a database of all the breached email addresses in prominent hacks like Gawker, Sony, and Adobe. I&rsquo;ve definitely been pwned, so it&rsquo;s a good service to use to quickly see if you need to change your passwords.</p>

<p>I plan to add the background task soon but I wanted the initial release out there so that I can just submit updates to it. If you want to contribute, send me a pull request!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cdn.marketplaceimages.windowsphone.com/v8/images/4eb4e175-0dd5-4e48-860b-639e6796b01b?rotation=90" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>I just released my second Windows Phone app, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/bowling-calculator/9287a99a-6068-4ff4-925b-988c8c99dbf6">Bowling Calculator</a>. It&rsquo;s an <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">open source app</a> that I created when <a href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">I gave my talk at TCCC15</a>.
If you&rsquo;re a fellow developer, feel free to send me a pull request with any bug fixes or enhancements. I want to keep it focused on
the simple use case of scoring a bowling game; I don&rsquo;t need it to track multiple games or keep track of history. It&rsquo;s purpose is to serve
as a production-ready sample app and to also be good at what it aims to do.</p>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/2013/12/05/miniprofiler-ravendb-pull-request-accepted/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-05T08:32:08-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2013/12/05/miniprofiler-ravendb-pull-request-accepted</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got a notification that my <a href="https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet/pull/15">pull request</a> for
adding RavenDB support to MiniProfiler went through! It&rsquo;s always really cool to see your contributions
get pulled in. The MiniProfiler guys were really easy-going, <a href="https://github.com/yellis">@yellis</a> was even kind enough to take on
the testing. That kind of acceptance for pull requests is great to see because it makes me feel good
about contributing and is a bit less intimidating.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>The &ldquo;official&rdquo; MiniProfiler RavenDB plugin does several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integrates with all existing MiniProfiler settings</li>
<li>Displays the query duration just like you&rsquo;d expect in a separate raven column

<ul>
<li>This let&rsquo;s you see the raven percentage individually just like SQL</li>
<li>It matches the experience of using EF with MiniProfiler exactly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allows you to dig into the exact request details ala EF integration</li>
<li>(not included) It&rsquo;s possible to also include the <em>results</em> of the request but in my pull request I don&rsquo;t because it was way too much
overhead to include the full response in the web interface (displaying 50 complex objects in JSON slowed down the UI too much)

<ul>
<li>You can just copy the query to see the results in Raven Studio anyway</li>
<li>Possibly you could just display the query URL and open the request in a new tab</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I have only just begun my exploration of RavenDB but one of the downsides from moving from EF was
the excellent MiniProfiler integration. I was really surprised to find adding the same level
of support to Raven was pretty straightforward in the latest iteration of MiniProfiler.</p>

<p>There are two packages I found that added profiling to Raven, the <a href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/tree/master/Raven.Client.MvcIntegration">&ldquo;official&rdquo; Raven profiler</a> and another
<a href="http://blog.csainty.com/MvcMiniProfiler.RavenDb/">MiniProfiler plugin</a>, but both of those are lacking. The official one didn&rsquo;t seem to handle AJAX requests
and the other only seemed to add profiling steps; it didn&rsquo;t provide any details about the request.
I wanted <strong>full</strong> integration with MiniProfiler on the same level as EF and I didn&rsquo;t want to enable <em>two</em> profilers at once. I was
already using MiniProfiler to profile my MVC app, I didn&rsquo;t want to enable Raven Profiler and MiniProfiler
at the same time.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb.contrib/tree/master/src/Raven.Client.Contrib.Profiling">a RavenDb.Contrib project</a> that added MiniProfiler integration on the level I wanted, but unfortunately it was not integrated
tightly into the MiniProfiler codebase (it was using reflection and other hacks) and it also was not built against the latest version of the codebase
that simplified the steps to create a new custom timing. Still, credit is due, because some of the formatting logic and general direction of my pull
request was taken from that contrib project.</p>

<p>I do not know what the release schedule is like for the next version of MiniProfiler, but I have my
RavenDB-based branch compiled and am using it for my site currently. You can bring down my fork
and compile it yourself too, if you&rsquo;re really interested in using it right now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just pushed a new version of Kamranicus that is built using the static site generator, <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. Octopress uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate static sites.</p>

<p>I decided to switch because I can leverage GitHub Pages which are <strong>free</strong> and I can use a custom domain. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit because I can just piggyback on GitHub&rsquo;s cloud hosting for free and not worry about incurring any downtime due to database issues (something that happened more than a few times with the last ASP.NET MVC and SQL-based site).</p>

<p>I really enjoyed setting up Octopress, it was easy to migrate my posts. I highly recommend it! It would be even better to have a .NET/C#-based static site generator that supported all of Jekyll&rsquo;s configuration options, except with Razor-based layouts and templating. Mmmm, that sounds pretty good. Someone get on that.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-03T03:09:04-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/79/just-pushed-blackjack-sample-game</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s finally done! I sat down today and dug through my backups to find my original WPF BlackJack game I wrote way back when WPF was really cool. I converted it to VS 2013, made sure it still ran, organized the solution, and hit deploy. It&rsquo;s now up on GitHub for your learning pleasure. There are no Nuget packages here! This was before Nuget where I had to find code to learn from and, ahem, copy. The deck is also something I found online. If I find the source, I&rsquo;ll be sure to attribute it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/">https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/</a></p>

<iframe src="http://kamranicus.com//player.vimeo.com/video/5122176" width="500" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This was a sample game I wrote to learn OO design and WPF. There&rsquo;s some cool animations, sound effects, and a pretty fun Blackjack implementation. It&rsquo;s very &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and should be easy to digest. I never got around to implementing all the cool AI but now that it&rsquo;s on GitHub for all to see, maybe someone will pick it up.</p>

<p>I also think it&rsquo;d be fun to port it to Windows 8 C# and XAML. It could be an app I release on the store, free and open source.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-20T21:11:30-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/78/tccc15-see-you-again-in-april</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, that was a blast. Yesterday was <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">TCCC15</a> and it was great. Many awesome sessions, including several by my fellow co-workers <a href="http://twitter.com/ErikOnarhem">Erik Onarheim</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenErstad">Stephen Erstad</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who attended <a href="http://kamranicus.com/Blog/Posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">my talk</a>! I got +10 votes on the code camp speaker site and 9 llamas, which made me feel pretty good!</p>

<p>Please send me feedback at my email or leave a comment here with your thoughts. The code will be available (soon) at <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling</a>. It&rsquo;ll be released under an open license but is meant to be educational. The app will also be available soon in the Windows Phone store.</p>

<p>If you missed my talk, you can still get all the bits once I release the app on GitHub. Sure, there won&rsquo;t be droning voice over the code, but you can still see all the steps I took to enhance it.</p>

<p>There was only one big hiccup where Nuget would not install a package, even when I had it in my local repository (it installed the other ones). I remembered some time ago Scott Hanselman mentioning that Nuget packages were just zip files. I quickly changed my Nuget package extension (because I didn&rsquo;t have Nuget Package Explorer installed), got the DLL, and added it as a project reference to quickly save my skin. Thanks Scott!</p>

    <updated>2013-10-17T15:17:14-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s talk time again! I&rsquo;m lucky to be giving yet another talk at Twin Cities Code Camp (my second one!). Last time was a lot of fun! This time, we&rsquo;re <a href="http://kamranicus.com/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">leaving the Web API pasture</a> and exploring the fun world of Windows Phone development.</p>

<p>TCCC15 is October 19 and I&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Schedule.aspx">speaking in Rapson 45 at 2:15pm</a>, so come say hi!</p>

<h2>Why You Should Attend</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an experienced or even a beginning Windows Phone developer, come. If you&rsquo;re still not sure why Windows Phone is cool, come.</p>

<p>The code I&rsquo;ll be showing will start out at a beginner level and move all the way passed intermediate to advanced. By the end, for example, you&rsquo;ll see how to implement a custom message box that fully supports Caliburn binding, dismissal, and the view lifecycle.</p>

<p>Finally, all the code will be available on GitHub soon after (this weekend?). I just need time to remove any secrets and figure out a license that will let me publish the app and own it while still allowing you all to learn from it.</p>

<h2>What We&rsquo;ll Talk About</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing a &ldquo;live coding&rdquo; presentation. In reality, I&rsquo;ll be coding and switching to Git branches that showcase the fully completed code then walk through it. The app I&rsquo;ll be presenting is actually a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; app; meaning that it works fine and does everything I need it to. However, anyone whose done app development can tell you that the work isn&rsquo;t done when your app runs and all your tests pass; there&rsquo;s still plenty of work making it &ldquo;production ready.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll cover in my session!</p>

<p>Right now, my talk is divided into 5 sections covering MVVM, fast resume, logging, about page, and UX improvement. The sections are designed in a way that will expose you to many different parts of my preferred MVVM framework, Caliburn. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll also learn some great tips &amp; tricks I&rsquo;ve found along my journey designing Windows Phone apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited because we&rsquo;ll start with the basic premise of an app (which works) and then take it to a production-ready application. Literally, <strong>by the end of the presentation</strong>, I could publish my app to the store and feel good about it.</p>

<p>I hope to see you on Saturday!</p>

<p>Will you be attending <a href="http://mdc.ilmservice.com">Minnesota Developer Conference</a>? Come see me at 12:45pm if you want to get jump started with creating connected Windows Phone apps. I&rsquo;ll be talking about how to connect to APIs and useful patterns I&rsquo;ve learned throughout my (limited) development experience. Even if you <em>have</em> developed an app, I hope to share some tips that might help improve your app and it&rsquo;ll definitely provide a jumping off point if you haven&rsquo;t started yet.</p>

<p>My current rehearsals clock in at around a 45 minute presentation which leaves a healthy 30 minutes for questions and seeing any live code, which will be at the audiences&#8217; whim. I&rsquo;ll be walking through a real application I&rsquo;m in the middle of developing so I hope to share some patterns and practices that I&rsquo;ve found useful when developing connected apps like MVVM, Async/Await, offline storage, and more.</p>

<p>See you on Thursday!</p>

<p>In Google Chrome:</p>

<li>Browse to chrome://flags</li>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs"/>
    <updated>2013-06-05T19:18:28-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with Knockout-based lists, I think the built-in events/callbacks provided by Knockout leave a bit to be desired. For example, a common case I here people complain about is that the <code>afterRender</code> callback for the <code>foreach/template</code> bindings executes for each item in the array, not after all the elements have been rendered.</p>

<p>There are probably better ways to <em>resolve</em> this using Promises (pun intended), but here&rsquo;s one way to attack it using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-65">Underscore.js</a>&rsquo;s <code>debounce</code> method that&rsquo;s easy to understand and use.</p>

<p>The <code>debounce</code> method:</p>

<blockquote><p>Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for N milliseconds. If immediate is passed, trigger the function on the leading edge, instead of the trailing.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is useful for high-octane events like rendering elements, window resizing, or capture mouse events.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a Fiddle that demonstrates a way to execute a callback after all the elements in a list have been rendered (and filters them to only <code>li</code> DOM elements):</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/yEhEt/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>This can be cleaned up multiple ways, I think a cleaner way to implement this would be through resolving a promise and then overriding the <code>foreach</code> and <code>template</code> binding to support it, for example, <code>afterAllRender</code> or something.</p>

<p>But this gets the job done and is easy to implement!</p>

    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/73/slides-and-resources-for-tccc14-web-api-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk this past weekend at Twin Cities Code Camp; it was my first public talk (hopefully the first of many?). It was a deep dive on selected ASP.NET Web API topics (as voted on by the audience) and you can view it on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kamranayub/diving-into-the-deep-wih-asp-dot-net">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://sdrv.ms/ZgUuGI">download the notes</a> (i.e. links, comments, resources) from my SkyDrive.</p>

<p>If you were there and saw me present, <a href="http://spkr8.com/t/21961">please rate how I did</a>! It&rsquo;s the only way I really have of getting feedback.</p>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>I thought it went decent for my first talk. I was pretty nervous; I even forgot to say my name&hellip; but whatever! Hopefully by volunteering to do more talks I&rsquo;ll get the hang of it. All those business leadership classes paid off, my friends said that I didn&rsquo;t appear nervous, I projected my voice, and some folks were kind enough to say they liked it which is all I wanted. I also got the largest room right after lunch and it was probably 200 degrees. The Wi-Fi was deathly slow (&lt; 1Mbps) so that didn&rsquo;t help. Next time I&rsquo;ll plan to either take more screenshots or limit the online interaction.</p>

<p>I also think I had too many topics; I knew we couldn&rsquo;t get through all of them but one of my co-workers suggested to scale it down in order to hit specific topics and spend more time on each. It&rsquo;s so hard because they&rsquo;re all great topics to talk about&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even list content negotiation or automatic documentation.</p>

<p>Overall I was pleased with the outcome; I said what I wanted to say and it was a lot of fun.</p>

    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/71/anecdote-i-frustrate-easily</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started my &ldquo;real job&rdquo; where I&rsquo;m at I was put on an internal site. It was a beast, it had a lot of history, and more importantly, it was <strong>damn ugly and sometimes hard to use</strong>. The site was used by developers and no one on the team had much UI experience. I was frustrated. I couldn&rsquo;t work on this thing and have it be ugly, why should we have a tool that gets used every day that&rsquo;s a bear to use? &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s always been that way&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me. For about a month I worked outside of work, off the sprint, and I re-tooled the CSS, markup, and UX while still maintaining the overall functionality and behavior. No one asked, I just did it <strong>because I was frustrated.</strong> Sure, at some points, people were sort of wondering what the heck I was doing but in the end, everyone loved the changes and everyone keeps mentioning how great the changes have been since. I believe it was also the start of a bigger push to make things easy to use internally but I suppose correlation does not equal causation :)</p>

    <updated>2013-04-24T05:14:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/70/protip-using-anti-forgery-token-with-aspnet-web-ap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just ran into and solved this problem so I thought I&rsquo;d share (I&rsquo;ll also be talking about this at my upcoming talk).</p>

<h3>Anti-Forgery in MVC</h3>

<p>In vanilla MVC, you&rsquo;d do anti-forgery like this in your Razor view:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then in a controller (POST):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="na">[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cool. But what about Web API? It uses a totally different pipeline and likely you&rsquo;re interacting with it via JQuery or other AJAX framework.</p>

<h3>ValidateHttpAntiForgeryToken</h3>

<p>Here are some references I used when trying to implement Anti-Forgery with Web API:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11725988/problems-implementing-validatingantiforgerytoken-attribute-for-web-api-with-mvc">Problems implementing ValidatingAntiForgeryToken attribute for Web API with MVC 4 RC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11476883/web-api-and-validateantiforgerytoken">Web API and ValidateAntiForgeryToken</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-(csrf">Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks</a>-attacks)</li>
<li>MVC 4 SPA template</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub: the two SO posts above implement this quite differently than the MVC 4 SPA template and the last article referenced. Both approaches actually worked locally for me, but both failed once I deployed to AppHarbor.</p>

<p>The long and short of it is that I was using the HTTP header <code>__RequestVerificationToken</code>. This is a no-no and I&rsquo;m sort of the dumb one here in that I should <em>know</em> not to use custom headers like that.</p>

<p>My friends, the <em>proper</em> way is to use the <code>X-*</code> convention, so the HTTP header in your AJAX requests become <code>X-XSRF-Token</code> instead.</p>

<p>Apparently, AppHarbor was stripping off the other header on AJAX POST. I was receiving an error about the given header could not be found.</p>

<p>The working solution is below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/5449779.js"></script>


<p>The <code>machineKey</code> thing is also key to remember on a cloud host/web farm environment.</p>

<p>I hope that helps somebody out there.</p>

<h3>Aside</h3>

<p>In the last article referenced, the <code>AntiForgery.GetTokens()</code> didn&rsquo;t work for me on AH. I kept getting the error:</p>

<pre><code>System.Web.Mvc.HttpAntiForgeryException (0x80004005): The required anti-forgery cookie "__RequestVerificationToken" is not present.
</code></pre>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get far enough to see what actual cookies were present because I switched to the other method outlined in the two SO posts. I just thought you should know that it just didn&rsquo;t work. I believe it&rsquo;s because <code>GetTokens</code> does not create a new cookie if the <code>cookieToken</code> has a value where as using <code>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()</code> does. The <a href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/9a83b63f3f889e3f2c979274fe3e8f7610e06b98#src/System.Web.WebPages/Helpers/AntiXsrf/AntiForgeryWorker.cs">source code</a> makes that clear in the comments. Why it worked locally I have no idea and at this point, don&rsquo;t care!</p>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/69/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-wor"/>
    <updated>2013-04-23T18:02:22-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/69/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-wor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve written a [long] article for Tech.pro on <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1222/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-worker-using-quartznet">how to use Quartz.NET to build an end-to-end background worker on AppHarbor</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to write a couple more follow-ups about more advanced usage of Quartz with a pretty big finale (I don&rsquo;t want to get anyone&rsquo;s hopes up though).</p>

<p>Some fun stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>~5300 words</li>
<li>~40 hours of work</li>
<li>~40 pages in PDF</li>
</ul>


<p>It seems longer than it is; most of it is code snippets and pictures but it takes about 20 minutes to read and about 45-60 minutes to work through (follow along).</p>

<p>I marked it as a Beginner tutorial and as such went into a lot of detail I wouldn&rsquo;t normally spend time on if it was just a blog post. I find writing formal articles forces me to verify what I know (or I think I know), explore alternatives, and do a deep-dive into whatever topic I want to talk about. It&rsquo;s mostly driven by fear: fear of being wrong, fear of being humiliated, fear of what other people think. Writing about a topic forces you to learn about things you maybe thought you knew but didn&rsquo;t really. I also believe it helps you become better at teaching others; if you can&rsquo;t explain what you know, do you really know it? At it&rsquo;s core, it&rsquo;s just good exercise!</p>

<p>I chose tech.pro because I like what they&rsquo;re trying to do, I like that they&rsquo;re open with development, and I also like the cash prize if your article is the top in its category ($1000). I also like that they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; your content; you&rsquo;re free to post it to other venues and it&rsquo;s your own work. I think it already has some great tutorials, including ones by someone I follow regularly, <a href="http://tech.pro/filipw/blog">Filip W</a>.</p>

    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/68/upcoming-events-rwd-workshop-code-camp-and-dotnetc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick set of FYIs. I will be attending 3 upcoming events, two in-person and one virtually.</p>

<h3>RWD Workshop with Tim Kadlec</h3>

<p><a href="http://timkadlec.com">Tim Kadlec</a> is a cool guy; he&rsquo;s also one of the RWD gurus and has lots to share. He&rsquo;s <a href="http://timkadlec.com/2013/04/implementing-responsive-design-workshop/">hosting a 30 person workshop</a> at the U of MN, so it&rsquo;ll be a small group of people that will be sharing RWD experiences. I&rsquo;m attending, and if prodded, I will share my experience implementing RWD on some big sites (hint: it&rsquo;s challenging).</p>

<h3>Code Camp</h3>

<p><a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> is a free conference put together by local volunteers and is a great event to go to if you like to see people&rsquo;s code or share your own. I will be <a href="http://kamranicus.com/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">talking about Web API</a> and opening up my closed-source project (Keep Track of My Games v2) for all to see. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting, for sure.</p>

<h3>dotNetConf</h3>

<p><a href="http://dotnetconf.net">dotNetConf</a> is a free virtual conference on all things .NET. I&rsquo;ll be attending a couple sessions at least and there&rsquo;s nothing to lose by attending. Be sure to check it out!</p>

<h3>Hack for MN</h3>

<p><a href="http://hackformn.eventbrite.com/">HackForMN</a> is for the National Day of Civic Hacking but for us Minnesotans. A handful of friends are going and I think there&rsquo;s probably a good app or two for The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes worth making.</p>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/67/ive-released-my-first-windows-phone-app-centwise"/>
    <updated>2013-04-11T22:47:42-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/67/ive-released-my-first-windows-phone-app-centwise</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m excited to talk about my latest project that just went live a couple weeks ago: <a href="http://centwiseapp.com">Centwise</a>. Centwise is a Windows Phone 7 &amp; 8 app client for a service that I use regularly, <a href="http://splitwise.com">Splitwise</a>.</p>

<p>You can download the app to your Windows Phone below:</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/getcentwise"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/410b39b16d0c759db1cbda923e968f91/tumblr_inline_mjvfbsUlMF1qz4rgp.png" alt="Get the app" /></a></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Splitwise?</h2>

<p><a href="http://splitwise.com">Splitwise</a> is a web app that lets you manage IOUs and bill splitting. I use it day-to-day during outings with friends but mainly I use it to keep track of bills and household expenses between me, my fiancee, and our roommate. It&rsquo;s a great tool and they provide native apps for iOS and Android. When I started Centwise, they didn&rsquo;t have a WP app and I figured as an avid user of the service, my first app could be a Splitwise client.</p>

<p>I really want to thank the Splitwise team (Jon &amp; Ryan!) for helping me out, answering questions, and for mentioning Centwise on their blog.</p>

<h2>First app experience</h2>

<p>I bought a HTC 8X when it was announced on Verizon day one. I knew I wanted to leave my old Droid Incredible in the dust and move on to greener pastures. Being a Microsoft stack guy, I figured Windows Phone would be good not only because I like the interface and experience but also because I could make some apps for the platform.</p>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked with WPF and XAML before, so learning the ins and outs of the pared-down Silverlight for Windows Phone wasn&rsquo;t too terrible but there were certainly roadblocks. I&rsquo;ve tried to bookmark every article or post I came across that helped me out, which I&rsquo;ll share at the end. Coming from a primarily web-based focus to a native XAML/C# platform was certainly jarring and there were times I slammed my hands on the keyboard exclaiming, &ldquo;THIS WOULD BE WAY EASIER IN CSS AND HTML!&rdquo; Like making a transparent button, for example.</p>

<p>I hope to go more in detail with certain issues as well as share some tips and tricks I learned along my journey to building my first app. There can be a lot of crazy things you wouldn&rsquo;t know XAML can do if you didn&rsquo;t spend time deconstructing bigger open-source libraries (which I <em>highly</em> recommend, I often kept <a href="http://phone.codeplex.com">Phone Toolkit</a> open alongside my own app to see how they built controls).</p>

<h2>The beginnings</h2>

<p>All apps have a beginning. Mine began on paper using the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeldorian/5071511857/">excellent paper templates</a> provided by Michael Bach.</p>

<p>Here are the paper sketches I made that helped me form the screens for the app. I spent most of my time sketching the more complex pages, the ones that needed to do or show a lot of stuff but where I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136892&authkey=ACGYGiJBJeURBfk" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136893&authkey=AEr0Ed2bQzMJx54" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136894&authkey=APrH1Wua6J8fLJU" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to do these types of sketches to help me visualize the UI. It also helps me see immediately whether or not my idea makes sense.</p>

<p>From there, I could start working on the XAML and the screens to put my ideas into the app. However, as you&rsquo;ll soon see, my first ideas usually weren&rsquo;t the best.</p>

<h2>Optimizing the UX</h2>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136892&authkey=ACGYGiJBJeURBfk" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>If you look at the first image, you can see that my initial idea when creating expenses was to display a list of people to choose from. In fact, pre-1.0 that is exactly what I had done. The flow looked like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User specifies &ldquo;Create an IOU&rdquo;</li>
<li>User chooses other person or chooses from address book</li>
<li>User is shown IOU screen</li>
</ol>


<p>This was pretty straightforward&hellip; after all, there are only 3 steps. But that was one step too many. It also ended up complicating my code quite a bit due to managing the back stack (i.e. what happens when a user cancels or hits &lsquo;Back&rsquo;).</p>

<p>In the final 1.0 release, I changed it to be easier and faster:</p>

<ol>
<li>User chooses to create an IOU</li>
<li>User is shown screen and either a) the other person is already populated or b) user can tap the avatar placeholder to choose someone</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s just one example of a change I had made that was different from my first implementation.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the second set of sketches, you can see I drastically changed how the IOU (and other) screens were laid out.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136893&authkey=AEr0Ed2bQzMJx54" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136609&authkey=AOWlC2tQqkFVW_A" width="180" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Here are just some of the changes I made:</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of a button, I created a <code>CalculatorTextBox</code> that combines a calculator and amount textbox into one.</li>
<li>This was huge because it also greatly simplified the UI of the Divide a Bill screen</li>
<li>Moved the currency button to the appbar menu items because it&rsquo;s not something a user will typically use often.</li>
<li>Made the static arrow shown between avatars a button to easily swap people in case the user made a mistake</li>
</ol>


<h2>Easy but not simple</h2>

<p>Someone wise once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Making things easy is <em>hard</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s been true with everything I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure to work on. Easy is hard.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any formal beta testers, mainly because the Windows Phone Dev Center didn&rsquo;t let me (<em>sigh</em>), but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from showing it to friends and family to have them test it out.</p>

<p>The core implementation of the app is pretty simple&hellip; it&rsquo;s all the extra work I had to put in to make the <em>app</em> simple that wasn&rsquo;t easy. Not only was it my first time trying to learn Windows Phone development, I also have a tendency to spend a lot of time on little things.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136736&authkey=AI7_LBxzEW-9MkM" width="180" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>For example, let&rsquo;s consider the &ldquo;people picker&rdquo; functionality. When a user wants to choose people to add to the expense, there&rsquo;s more logic than simply &ldquo;show the user&rsquo;s friends&rdquo;. The control actually does several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the user adds an expense type in the context of a group, then the picker shows the people in that group first.</li>
<li>If the user divides a bill from the home screen, the picker shows available groups which:</li>
<li>Automatically adds all the people in that group to the bill</li>
<li>Sets the &ldquo;filed in&rdquo; value to the group they chose, regardless of the context the user was in (home screen vs. group)</li>
<li>Makes sure not to show people already added to the expense</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s the user choose someone from the address book (but not for payments!)</li>
</ol>


<p>I use this people picker anywhere I need to, including when creating a group. By reusing the same experience, the user never has to learn a new way of picking people.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just a ton of little things like that throughout the app that the user probably won&rsquo;t ever notice but I hope surfaces in the form of, &ldquo;Hey, this is easy to use!&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want the app to get in the way of the user doing whatever they needed to do.</p>

<p>I cannot count the amount of hours I&rsquo;ve spent so far, although I tried to keep track at first but once I hit 60+ hours in less than a week, I stopped. Luckily, GitHub has a great visualization of how often I worked the app:</p>

<p><strong>Commit Activity</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://kamranicus.com/blog/images/72.png" alt="I am insane" /></p>

<p>Let me break it down for you: I am insane.</p>

<p><img src="http://kamranicus.com/blog/images/73.png" alt="Seriously, insane" /></p>

<p>You can forgive me if I plan to take it a bit slower with updates. I was hoping to finish in time for the Next App Star challenge but unfortunately even spending countless hours during the week, the app just wasn&rsquo;t in a good state in time for that deadline.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>I hope to go into more technical detail around some of the things I did with my app at a later point. I was really excited to learn how to build a Windows Phone app and am very pleased with the result. I didn&rsquo;t build it expecting to make thousands of dollars; I&rsquo;ll be lucky (and happy) if I break $500 but making it a paid-for app motivates me as a single developer to keep the app up-to-date and full of useful features. I have personal projects and open projects that eat up time that I need to make sure I can support each one of them.</p>

<p>As far as what I have planned, you can keep tabs on <a href="http://centwiseapp.com">CentwiseApp.com</a> or follow Centwise on <a href="http://twitter.com/centwiseapp">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com/centwise">Facebook</a>. I hope to do a UI refresh soon and I have about 20+ enhancements to incrementally add. I already released the <a href="http://centwiseapp.com/post/46850512483/update-v1-1-will-be-available-today">1.1 update</a> that added several new features, so that&rsquo;s a good start!</p>

    <updated>2013-03-05T20:59:46-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be in the 12:45pm track, come see me crash and burn!</p>

<p>Yay! I was just informed by TCCC that I&rsquo;ve made it onto the <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Spring2013/Sessions.aspx#s22">Sessions list</a> so I guess I&rsquo;m officially a speaker. This would be the very first time I&rsquo;m giving a public talk <em>on my own</em>. I was part of a session at MinneWebCon when I spoke about my work on the Student Unions &amp; Activities touch-screen directory, so I have <em>at least</em> 15 minutes under my belt.</p>

<h3>Session? Or Presentation?</h3>

<p>Presentation is a strong and loaded word. It brings to mind a boring PowerPoint slideshow of stuff no one ever reads. It brings to mind a stale &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk at you&rdquo; type of feeling, where the &ldquo;participants&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t actually participating.</p>

<p>No, my session at TCCC is not like that. I did a 20 minute version of the session at work and it went well, though I didn&rsquo;t have much time to dive into real code, which is definitely what I plan to do at TCCC&hellip; after all, it is a <strong>code camp</strong>. I will be showing some information about the topics I cover but other than that, we will be diving into the bowels of my app&hellip; for better or worse.</p>

<h3>ASP.NET Web API: What now?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Web API for a bit, it&rsquo;ll be a core part of the next <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>. In fact, the beta version of KTOMG will be what I will use to demo all my code and ideas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on it. I&rsquo;m not even &ldquo;great&rdquo; at it. I&rsquo;m just a regular developer who is using it on a real project and I&rsquo;ve run into &ldquo;real&rdquo; issues. The main reason I wanted to do a session on Web API is because of a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web API is awesome and everyone should know about it</li>
<li>Some things aren&rsquo;t apparent when you&rsquo;re starting out doing API development</li>
<li>Most presentations on Web API are cursory overviews</li>
<li>It can be hard to know what the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do things is</li>
</ol>


<p>Regarding #4, this is a hard thing to talk about&hellip; since I still don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;what the right way&rdquo; is and I think it depends on your situation. However, at the very least, I can tell you <em>what I did</em> and <em>what works for me</em> and maybe you can leave the session with a better idea of what it is you want to do.</p>

<h3>So what&rsquo;s on the agenda?</h3>

<p>Lots of stuff, and I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t get to a lot of it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugging tips</li>
<li>CSRF prevention</li>
<li>Custom routing (w/client-side)</li>
<li>Custom error handling</li>
<li>Integration with the client-side</li>
<li>Working with multiple clients (phone, Windows 8, etc.)</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Async actions</li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;ll be plenty to show and plenty more to discuss. I&rsquo;m more interested in seeing what others have done or would recommend.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited, so I&rsquo;ll see you April 27!</p>
