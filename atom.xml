    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s finally done! I sat down today and dug through my backups to find my original WPF BlackJack game I wrote way back when WPF was really cool. I converted it to VS 2013, made sure it still ran, organized the solution, and hit deploy. It&rsquo;s now up on GitHub for your learning pleasure. There are no Nuget packages here! This was before Nuget where I had to find code to learn from and, ahem, copy. The deck is also something I found online. If I find the source, I&rsquo;ll be sure to attribute it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/">https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/</a></p>

<p>This was a sample game I wrote to learn OO design and WPF. There&rsquo;s some cool animations, sound effects, and a pretty fun Blackjack implementation. It&rsquo;s very &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and should be easy to digest. I never got around to implementing all the cool AI but now that it&rsquo;s on GitHub for all to see, maybe someone will pick it up.</p>

<p>I also think it&rsquo;d be fun to port it to Windows 8 C# and XAML. It could be an app I release on the store, free and open source.</p>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/78/tccc15-see-you-again-in-april</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, that was a blast. Yesterday was <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">TCCC15</a> and it was great. Many awesome sessions, including several by my fellow co-workers <a href="http://twitter.com/ErikOnarhem">Erik Onarheim</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenErstad">Stephen Erstad</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who attended <a href="http://kamranayub.github.io/Blog/Posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">my talk</a>! I got +10 votes on the code camp speaker site and 9 llamas, which made me feel pretty good!</p>

<p>Please send me feedback at my email or leave a comment here with your thoughts. The code will be available (soon) at <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling</a>. It&rsquo;ll be released under an open license but is meant to be educational. The app will also be available soon in the Windows Phone store.</p>

<p>If you missed my talk, you can still get all the bits once I release the app on GitHub. Sure, there won&rsquo;t be droning voice over the code, but you can still see all the steps I took to enhance it.</p>

<p>There was only one big hiccup where Nuget would not install a package, even when I had it in my local repository (it installed the other ones). I remembered some time ago Scott Hanselman mentioning that Nuget packages were just zip files. I quickly changed my Nuget package extension (because I didn&rsquo;t have Nuget Package Explorer installed), got the DLL, and added it as a project reference to quickly save my skin. Thanks Scott!</p>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s talk time again! I&rsquo;m lucky to be giving yet another talk at Twin Cities Code Camp (my second one!). Last time was a lot of fun! This time, we&rsquo;re <a href="http://kamranayub.github.io/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">leaving the Web API pasture</a> and exploring the fun world of Windows Phone development.</p>

<p>TCCC15 is October 19 and I&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Schedule.aspx">speaking in Rapson 45 at 2:15pm</a>, so come say hi!</p>

<h2>Why You Should Attend</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an experienced or even a beginning Windows Phone developer, come. If you&rsquo;re still not sure why Windows Phone is cool, come.</p>

<p>The code I&rsquo;ll be showing will start out at a beginner level and move all the way passed intermediate to advanced. By the end, for example, you&rsquo;ll see how to implement a custom message box that fully supports Caliburn binding, dismissal, and the view lifecycle.</p>

<p>Finally, all the code will be available on GitHub soon after (this weekend?). I just need time to remove any secrets and figure out a license that will let me publish the app and own it while still allowing you all to learn from it.</p>

<h2>What We&rsquo;ll Talk About</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing a &ldquo;live coding&rdquo; presentation. In reality, I&rsquo;ll be coding and switching to Git branches that showcase the fully completed code then walk through it. The app I&rsquo;ll be presenting is actually a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; app; meaning that it works fine and does everything I need it to. However, anyone whose done app development can tell you that the work isn&rsquo;t done when your app runs and all your tests pass; there&rsquo;s still plenty of work making it &ldquo;production ready.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll cover in my session!</p>

<p>Right now, my talk is divided into 5 sections covering MVVM, fast resume, logging, about page, and UX improvement. The sections are designed in a way that will expose you to many different parts of my preferred MVVM framework, Caliburn. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll also learn some great tips &amp; tricks I&rsquo;ve found along my journey designing Windows Phone apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited because we&rsquo;ll start with the basic premise of an app (which works) and then take it to a production-ready application. Literally, <strong>by the end of the presentation</strong>, I could publish my app to the store and feel good about it.</p>

<p>I hope to see you on Saturday!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> My session slides are available online at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kamranayub/bending-apis-to-your-will-using-windows-phone">SpeakerDeck</a>. If you attended, I hope you enjoyed it!</p>

<p>Will you be attending <a href="http://mdc.ilmservice.com">Minnesota Developer Conference</a>? Come see me at 12:45pm if you want to get jump started with creating connected Windows Phone apps. I&rsquo;ll be talking about how to connect to APIs and useful patterns I&rsquo;ve learned throughout my (limited) development experience. Even if you <em>have</em> developed an app, I hope to share some tips that might help improve your app and it&rsquo;ll definitely provide a jumping off point if you haven&rsquo;t started yet.</p>

<p>My current rehearsals clock in at around a 45 minute presentation which leaves a healthy 30 minutes for questions and seeing any live code, which will be at the audiences&#8217; whim. I&rsquo;ll be walking through a real application I&rsquo;m in the middle of developing so I hope to share some patterns and practices that I&rsquo;ve found useful when developing connected apps like MVVM, Async/Await, offline storage, and more.</p>

<p>See you on Thursday!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This comes directly from a tip <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/engjbw">Mike Zarandona posted on Coderwall</a>, which I&rsquo;m posting here to keep track of it:</p>

<hr />

<p>I was sick of borrowing a friend&rsquo;s retina laptop to test retina images. After a little poking around, I discovered a few options baked right into the most popular browsers.</p>

<p>In Google Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li>Browse to chrome://flags</li>
<li>Search for and enable Force high DPI mode</li>
</ul>


<p>In FireFox:</p>

<ul>
<li>Browse to about:config</li>
<li>Search for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</li>

    <link href="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs"/>
    <updated>2013-06-05T19:18:28-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with Knockout-based lists, I think the built-in events/callbacks provided by Knockout leave a bit to be desired. For example, a common case I here people complain about is that the <code>afterRender</code> callback for the <code>foreach/template</code> bindings executes for each item in the array, not after all the elements have been rendered.</p>

<p>There are probably better ways to <em>resolve</em> this using Promises (pun intended), but here&rsquo;s one way to attack it using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-65">Underscore.js</a>&rsquo;s <code>debounce</code> method that&rsquo;s easy to understand and use.</p>

<p>The <code>debounce</code> method:</p>

<blockquote><p>Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for N milliseconds. If immediate is passed, trigger the function on the leading edge, instead of the trailing.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is useful for high-octane events like rendering elements, window resizing, or capture mouse events.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a Fiddle that demonstrates a way to execute a callback after all the elements in a list have been rendered (and filters them to only <code>li</code> DOM elements):</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/yEhEt/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>This can be cleaned up multiple ways, I think a cleaner way to implement this would be through resolving a promise and then overriding the <code>foreach</code> and <code>template</code> binding to support it, for example, <code>afterAllRender</code> or something.</p>

<p>But this gets the job done and is easy to implement!</p>

    <updated>2013-04-29T22:39:24-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/73/slides-and-resources-for-tccc14-web-api-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk this past weekend at Twin Cities Code Camp; it was my first public talk (hopefully the first of many?). It was a deep dive on selected ASP.NET Web API topics (as voted on by the audience) and you can view it on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kamranayub/diving-into-the-deep-wih-asp-dot-net">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://sdrv.ms/ZgUuGI">download the notes</a> (i.e. links, comments, resources) from my SkyDrive.</p>

<p>If you were there and saw me present, <a href="http://spkr8.com/t/21961">please rate how I did</a>! It&rsquo;s the only way I really have of getting feedback.</p>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>I thought it went decent for my first talk. I was pretty nervous; I even forgot to say my name&hellip; but whatever! Hopefully by volunteering to do more talks I&rsquo;ll get the hang of it. All those business leadership classes paid off, my friends said that I didn&rsquo;t appear nervous, I projected my voice, and some folks were kind enough to say they liked it which is all I wanted. I also got the largest room right after lunch and it was probably 200 degrees. The Wi-Fi was deathly slow (&lt; 1Mbps) so that didn&rsquo;t help. Next time I&rsquo;ll plan to either take more screenshots or limit the online interaction.</p>

<p>I also think I had too many topics; I knew we couldn&rsquo;t get through all of them but one of my co-workers suggested to scale it down in order to hit specific topics and spend more time on each. It&rsquo;s so hard because they&rsquo;re all great topics to talk about&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even list content negotiation or automatic documentation.</p>

<p>Overall I was pleased with the outcome; I said what I wanted to say and it was a lot of fun.</p>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/71/anecdote-i-frustrate-easily</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started my &ldquo;real job&rdquo; where I&rsquo;m at I was put on an internal site. It was a beast, it had a lot of history, and more importantly, it was <strong>damn ugly and sometimes hard to use</strong>. The site was used by developers and no one on the team had much UI experience. I was frustrated. I couldn&rsquo;t work on this thing and have it be ugly, why should we have a tool that gets used every day that&rsquo;s a bear to use? &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s always been that way&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me. For about a month I worked outside of work, off the sprint, and I re-tooled the CSS, markup, and UX while still maintaining the overall functionality and behavior. No one asked, I just did it <strong>because I was frustrated.</strong> Sure, at some points, people were sort of wondering what the heck I was doing but in the end, everyone loved the changes and everyone keeps mentioning how great the changes have been since. I believe it was also the start of a bigger push to make things easy to use internally but I suppose correlation does not equal causation :)</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s what <a href="http://zachholman.com/">Zach Holman</a> means when he says to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/holman/keeping-people?slide=31">hire people who frustrate easily</a> and that&rsquo;s what triggered this anecdote.</p>

    <link href="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/70/protip-using-anti-forgery-token-with-aspnet-web-ap"/>
    <updated>2013-04-24T05:14:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/70/protip-using-anti-forgery-token-with-aspnet-web-ap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just ran into and solved this problem so I thought I&rsquo;d share (I&rsquo;ll also be talking about this at my upcoming talk).</p>

<h3>Anti-Forgery in MVC</h3>

<p>In vanilla MVC, you&rsquo;d do anti-forgery like this in your Razor view:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then in a controller (POST):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="na">[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cool. But what about Web API? It uses a totally different pipeline and likely you&rsquo;re interacting with it via JQuery or other AJAX framework.</p>

<h3>ValidateHttpAntiForgeryToken</h3>

<p>Here are some references I used when trying to implement Anti-Forgery with Web API:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11725988/problems-implementing-validatingantiforgerytoken-attribute-for-web-api-with-mvc">Problems implementing ValidatingAntiForgeryToken attribute for Web API with MVC 4 RC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11476883/web-api-and-validateantiforgerytoken">Web API and ValidateAntiForgeryToken</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-%28csrf%29-attacks">Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks</a></li>
<li>MVC 4 SPA template</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub: the two SO posts above implement this quite differently than the MVC 4 SPA template and the last article referenced. Both approaches actually worked locally for me, but both failed once I deployed to AppHarbor.</p>

<p>The long and short of it is that I was using the HTTP header <code>__RequestVerificationToken</code>. This is a no-no and I&rsquo;m sort of the dumb one here in that I should <em>know</em> not to use custom headers like that.</p>

<p>My friends, the <em>proper</em> way is to use the <code>X-*</code> convention, so the HTTP header in your AJAX requests become <code>X-XSRF-Token</code> instead.</p>

<p>Apparently, AppHarbor was stripping off the other header on AJAX POST. I was receiving an error about the given header could not be found.</p>

<p>The working solution is below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/5449779.js"></script>


<p>The <code>machineKey</code> thing is also key to remember on a cloud host/web farm environment.</p>

<p>I hope that helps somebody out there.</p>

<h3>Aside</h3>

<p>In the last article referenced, the <code>AntiForgery.GetTokens()</code> didn&rsquo;t work for me on AH. I kept getting the error:</p>

<pre><code>System.Web.Mvc.HttpAntiForgeryException (0x80004005): The required anti-forgery cookie "__RequestVerificationToken" is not present.
</code></pre>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get far enough to see what actual cookies were present because I switched to the other method outlined in the two SO posts. I just thought you should know that it just didn&rsquo;t work. I believe it&rsquo;s because <code>GetTokens</code> does not create a new cookie if the <code>cookieToken</code> has a value where as using <code>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()</code> does. The <a href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/9a83b63f3f889e3f2c979274fe3e8f7610e06b98#src/System.Web.WebPages/Helpers/AntiXsrf/AntiForgeryWorker.cs">source code</a> makes that clear in the comments. Why it worked locally I have no idea and at this point, don&rsquo;t care!</p>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/69/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-wor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve written a [long] article for Tech.pro on <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1222/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-worker-using-quartznet">how to use Quartz.NET to build an end-to-end background worker on AppHarbor</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to write a couple more follow-ups about more advanced usage of Quartz with a pretty big finale (I don&rsquo;t want to get anyone&rsquo;s hopes up though).</p>

<p>Some fun stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>~5300 words</li>
<li>~40 hours of work</li>
<li>~40 pages in PDF</li>
</ul>


<p>It seems longer than it is; most of it is code snippets and pictures but it takes about 20 minutes to read and about 45-60 minutes to work through (follow along).</p>

<p>I marked it as a Beginner tutorial and as such went into a lot of detail I wouldn&rsquo;t normally spend time on if it was just a blog post. I find writing formal articles forces me to verify what I know (or I think I know), explore alternatives, and do a deep-dive into whatever topic I want to talk about. It&rsquo;s mostly driven by fear: fear of being wrong, fear of being humiliated, fear of what other people think. Writing about a topic forces you to learn about things you maybe thought you knew but didn&rsquo;t really. I also believe it helps you become better at teaching others; if you can&rsquo;t explain what you know, do you really know it? At it&rsquo;s core, it&rsquo;s just good exercise!</p>

<p>I chose tech.pro because I like what they&rsquo;re trying to do, I like that they&rsquo;re open with development, and I also like the cash prize if your article is the top in its category ($1000). I also like that they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; your content; you&rsquo;re free to post it to other venues and it&rsquo;s your own work. I think it already has some great tutorials, including ones by someone I follow regularly, <a href="http://tech.pro/filipw/blog">Filip W</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick set of FYIs. I will be attending 3 upcoming events, two in-person and one virtually.</p>

<h3>RWD Workshop with Tim Kadlec</h3>

<p><a href="http://timkadlec.com">Tim Kadlec</a> is a cool guy; he&rsquo;s also one of the RWD gurus and has lots to share. He&rsquo;s <a href="http://timkadlec.com/2013/04/implementing-responsive-design-workshop/">hosting a 30 person workshop</a> at the U of MN, so it&rsquo;ll be a small group of people that will be sharing RWD experiences. I&rsquo;m attending, and if prodded, I will share my experience implementing RWD on some big sites (hint: it&rsquo;s challenging).</p>

<h3>Code Camp</h3>

<p><a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> is a free conference put together by local volunteers and is a great event to go to if you like to see people&rsquo;s code or share your own. I will be <a href="http://kamranayub.github.io/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">talking about Web API</a> and opening up my closed-source project (Keep Track of My Games v2) for all to see.

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/67/ive-released-my-first-windows-phone-app-centwise</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m excited to talk about my latest project that just went live a couple weeks ago: <a href="http://centwiseapp.com">Centwise</a>. Centwise is a Windows Phone 7 &amp; 8 app client for a service that I use regularly, <a href="http://splitwise.com">Splitwise</a>.</p>

<p>You can download the app to your Windows Phone below:</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/getcentwise"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/410b39b16d0c759db1cbda923e968f91/tumblr_inline_mjvfbsUlMF1qz4rgp.png" alt="Get the app" /></a></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Splitwise?</h2>

<p><a href="http://splitwise.com">Splitwise</a> is a web app that lets you manage IOUs and bill splitting. I use it day-to-day during outings with friends but mainly I use it to keep track of bills and household expenses between me, my fiancee, and our roommate. It&rsquo;s a great tool and they provide native apps for iOS and Android. When I started Centwise, they didn&rsquo;t have a WP app and I figured as an avid user of the service, my first app could be a Splitwise client.</p>

<p>I really want to thank the Splitwise team (Jon &amp; Ryan!) for helping me out, answering questions, and for mentioning Centwise on their blog.</p>

<h2>First app experience</h2>

<p>I bought a HTC 8X when it was announced on Verizon day one. I knew I wanted to leave my old Droid Incredible in the dust and move on to greener pastures. Being a Microsoft stack guy, I figured Windows Phone would be good not only because I like the interface and experience but also because I could make some apps for the platform.</p>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked with WPF and XAML before, so learning the ins and outs of the pared-down Silverlight for Windows Phone wasn&rsquo;t too terrible but there were certainly roadblocks. I&rsquo;ve tried to bookmark every article or post I came across that helped me out, which I&rsquo;ll share at the end. Coming from a primarily web-based focus to a native XAML/C# platform was certainly jarring and there were times I slammed my hands on the keyboard exclaiming, &ldquo;THIS WOULD BE WAY EASIER IN CSS AND HTML!&rdquo; Like making a transparent button, for example.</p>

<p>I hope to go more in detail with certain issues as well as share some tips and tricks I learned along my journey to building my first app. There can be a lot of crazy things you wouldn&rsquo;t know XAML can do if you didn&rsquo;t spend time deconstructing bigger open-source libraries (which I <em>highly</em> recommend, I often kept <a href="http://phone.codeplex.com">Phone Toolkit</a> open alongside my own app to see how they built controls).</p>

<h2>The beginnings</h2>

<p>All apps have a beginning. Mine began on paper using the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeldorian/5071511857/">excellent paper templates</a> provided by Michael Bach.</p>

<p>Here are the paper sketches I made that helped me form the screens for the app. I spent most of my time sketching the more complex pages, the ones that needed to do or show a lot of stuff but where I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136892&authkey=ACGYGiJBJeURBfk" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136893&authkey=AEr0Ed2bQzMJx54" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136894&authkey=APrH1Wua6J8fLJU" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to do these types of sketches to help me visualize the UI. It also helps me see immediately whether or not my idea makes sense.</p>

<p>From there, I could start working on the XAML and the screens to put my ideas into the app. However, as you&rsquo;ll soon see, my first ideas usually weren&rsquo;t the best.</p>

<h2>Optimizing the UX</h2>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136892&authkey=ACGYGiJBJeURBfk" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>If you look at the first image, you can see that my initial idea when creating expenses was to display a list of people to choose from. In fact, pre-1.0 that is exactly what I had done. The flow looked like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User specifies &ldquo;Create an IOU&rdquo;</li>
<li>User chooses other person or chooses from address book</li>
<li>User is shown IOU screen</li>
</ol>


<p>This was pretty straightforward&hellip; after all, there are only 3 steps. But that was one step too many. It also ended up complicating my code quite a bit due to managing the back stack (i.e. what happens when a user cancels or hits &lsquo;Back&rsquo;).</p>

<p>In the final 1.0 release, I changed it to be easier and faster:</p>

<ol>
<li>User chooses to create an IOU</li>
<li>User is shown screen and either a) the other person is already populated or b) user can tap the avatar placeholder to choose someone</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s just one example of a change I had made that was different from my first implementation.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the second set of sketches, you can see I drastically changed how the IOU (and other) screens were laid out.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136893&authkey=AEr0Ed2bQzMJx54" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136609&authkey=AOWlC2tQqkFVW_A" width="180" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Here are just some of the changes I made:</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of a button, I created a <code>CalculatorTextBox</code> that combines a calculator and amount textbox into one.</li>
<li>This was huge because it also greatly simplified the UI of the Divide a Bill screen</li>
<li>Moved the currency button to the appbar menu items because it&rsquo;s not something a user will typically use often.</li>
<li>Made the static arrow shown between avatars a button to easily swap people in case the user made a mistake</li>
</ol>


<h2>Easy but not simple</h2>

<p>Someone wise once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Making things easy is <em>hard</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s been true with everything I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure to work on. Easy is hard.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any formal beta testers, mainly because the Windows Phone Dev Center didn&rsquo;t let me (<em>sigh</em>), but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from showing it to friends and family to have them test it out.</p>

<p>The core implementation of the app is pretty simple&hellip; it&rsquo;s all the extra work I had to put in to make the <em>app</em> simple that wasn&rsquo;t easy. Not only was it my first time trying to learn Windows Phone development, I also have a tendency to spend a lot of time on little things.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136736&authkey=AI7_LBxzEW-9MkM" width="180" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>For example, let&rsquo;s consider the &ldquo;people picker&rdquo; functionality. When a user wants to choose people to add to the expense, there&rsquo;s more logic than simply &ldquo;show the user&rsquo;s friends&rdquo;. The control actually does several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the user adds an expense type in the context of a group, then the picker shows the people in that group first.</li>
<li>If the user divides a bill from the home screen, the picker shows available groups which:</li>
<li>Automatically adds all the people in that group to the bill</li>
<li>Sets the &ldquo;filed in&rdquo; value to the group they chose, regardless of the context the user was in (home screen vs. group)</li>
<li>Makes sure not to show people already added to the expense</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s the user choose someone from the address book (but not for payments!)</li>
</ol>


<p>I use this people picker anywhere I need to, including when creating a group. By reusing the same experience, the user never has to learn a new way of picking people.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just a ton of little things like that throughout the app that the user probably won&rsquo;t ever notice but I hope surfaces in the form of, &ldquo;Hey, this is easy to use!&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want the app to get in the way of the user doing whatever they needed to do.</p>

<p>I cannot count the amount of hours I&rsquo;ve spent so far, although I tried to keep track at first but once I hit 60+ hours in less than a week, I stopped. Luckily, GitHub has a great visualization of how often I worked the app:</p>

<p><strong>Commit Activity</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/images/72.png" alt="I am insane" /></p>

<p>Let me break it down for you: I am insane.</p>

<p><img src="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/images/73.png" alt="Seriously, insane" /></p>

<p>You can forgive me if I plan to take it a bit slower with updates. I was hoping to finish in time for the Next App Star challenge but unfortunately even spending countless hours during the week, the app just wasn&rsquo;t in a good state in time for that deadline.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>I hope to go into more technical detail around some of the things I did with my app at a later point. I was really excited to learn how to build a Windows Phone app and am very pleased with the result. I didn&rsquo;t build it expecting to make thousands of dollars; I&rsquo;ll be lucky (and happy) if I break $500 but making it a paid-for app motivates me as a single developer to keep the app up-to-date and full of useful features. I have personal projects and open projects that eat up time that I need to make sure I can support each one of them.</p>

<p>As far as what I have planned, you can keep tabs on <a href="http://centwiseapp.com">CentwiseApp.com</a> or follow Centwise on <a href="http://twitter.com/centwiseapp">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com/centwise">Facebook</a>. I hope to do a UI refresh soon and I have about 20+ enhancements to incrementally add. I already released the <a href="http://centwiseapp.com/post/46850512483/update-v1-1-will-be-available-today">1.1 update</a> that added several new features, so that&rsquo;s a good start!</p>

    <link href="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp"/>
    <updated>2013-03-05T20:59:46-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be in the 12:45pm track, come see me crash and burn!</p>

<p>Yay! I was just informed by TCCC that I&rsquo;ve made it onto the <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Spring2013/Sessions.aspx#s22">Sessions list</a> so I guess I&rsquo;m officially a speaker. This would be the very first time I&rsquo;m giving a public talk <em>on my own</em>. I was part of a session at MinneWebCon when I spoke about my work on the Student Unions &amp; Activities touch-screen directory, so I have <em>at least</em> 15 minutes under my belt.</p>

<h3>Session? Or Presentation?</h3>

<p>Presentation is a strong and loaded word. It brings to mind a boring PowerPoint slideshow of stuff no one ever reads. It brings to mind a stale &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk at you&rdquo; type of feeling, where the &ldquo;participants&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t actually participating.</p>

<p>No, my session at TCCC is not like that. I did a 20 minute version of the session at work and it went well, though I didn&rsquo;t have much time to dive into real code, which is definitely what I plan to do at TCCC&hellip; after all, it is a <strong>code camp</strong>. I will be showing some information about the topics I cover but other than that, we will be diving into the bowels of my app&hellip; for better or worse.</p>

<h3>ASP.NET Web API: What now?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Web API for a bit, it&rsquo;ll be a core part of the next <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>. In fact, the beta version of KTOMG will be what I will use to demo all my code and ideas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on it. I&rsquo;m not even &ldquo;great&rdquo; at it. I&rsquo;m just a regular developer who is using it on a real project and I&rsquo;ve run into &ldquo;real&rdquo; issues. The main reason I wanted to do a session on Web API is because of a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web API is awesome and everyone should know about it</li>
<li>Some things aren&rsquo;t apparent when you&rsquo;re starting out doing API development</li>
<li>Most presentations on Web API are cursory overviews</li>
<li>It can be hard to know what the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do things is</li>
</ol>


<p>Regarding #4, this is a hard thing to talk about&hellip; since I still don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;what the right way&rdquo; is and I think it depends on your situation. However, at the very least, I can tell you <em>what I did</em> and <em>what works for me</em> and maybe you can leave the session with a better idea of what it is you want to do.</p>

<h3>So what&rsquo;s on the agenda?</h3>

<p>Lots of stuff, and I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t get to a lot of it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugging tips</li>
<li>CSRF prevention</li>
<li>Custom routing (w/client-side)</li>
<li>Custom error handling</li>
<li>Integration with the client-side</li>
<li>Working with multiple clients (phone, Windows 8, etc.)</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Async actions</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/64/bindableappbar-for-caliburn-micro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> Matteo Pagani has a <a href="http://wp.qmatteoq.com/first-steps-with-caliburn-micro-the-application-bar/">great introduction</a> on setting up the BindableAppBar. Thanks Matteo!</p>

<p>Anyone who has done Windows Phone development will tell you: the appbar sucks.</p>

<p>It sucks for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a <code>DependencyObject</code> so you can&rsquo;t use binding</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t support commands</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to make it dynamic because it must be maniuplated in code</li>
<li>It sucks</li>
</ul>


<p>Given those reasons, it&rsquo;s no surprise people have come up with &ldquo;bindable app bars&rdquo; that are basically wrappers around the appbar that allow binding, manipulation, and such.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of those solutions have come to Caliburn. Caliburn <em>does</em> provide basic message binding support and IsEnabled guarding, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>So, given that I <strong>really</strong> wanted to start binding some appbars hardcore, I decided to spend a day and make it happen.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing the Caliburn.Micro.BindableAppBar</strong>: you can enjoy the fruits of my labor on <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Caliburn.Micro.BindableAppBar/">Nuget</a> or at the <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/CaliburnBindableAppBar">GitHub</a> repository. Here&rsquo;s hoping Rob brings this into core so it&rsquo;ll just &ldquo;be there&rdquo; and integrated more into the overall Caliburn system.</p>

<p>The big benefit is the ability to easily use multiple appbars on a single view <strong>and</strong> in conducted Pivot/Panorama views. In my case, I do both, because one pivot page has two states (a selection state and a browsing state) and both requires two different appbars. The other pivot page doesn&rsquo;t need all the cruft of the first pivot&rsquo;s appbar, so only one button is present on it.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-05T17:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/65/i-forked-fastjson</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Windows Phone app mainly deals with talking to a web API. I&rsquo;ve previously had good experience using RestSharp but now with the new <code>async/await</code> features, I&rsquo;ve been trying to only use <code>Task</code>-based stuff. I gotta say, I&rsquo;m loving it.</p>

<p>RestSharp for WP does not natively support async/await but you can wrap it yourself. However, why not just use <code>HttpClient</code>? So that&rsquo;s what I did. I ripped out RestSharp and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/neuecc/AsyncOAuth">AsyncOAuth</a> (which depends on HttpClient).</p>

<p>Besides OAuth, the other issue you&rsquo;ll run into is what serializer/deserializer to use. You could go with JSON.NET, or ServiceStack, but those are two extremes&hellip; one being very flexible and other being very inflexible. I needed an in-between but also something very fast and that&rsquo;s exactly what <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/159450/fastJSON">fastJSON</a> is.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s fast because of the same reason SS is fast: it doesn&rsquo;t do any fancy property matching. When you&rsquo;re dealing with APIs, it&rsquo;s rare that the response they send back matches exactly with your object model and properties (especially C#). That&rsquo;s why the name variance feature of the larger libraries is awesome.</p>

<p>So, I did what any good developer would, I dug in and added it. I also added <code>rootElement</code> support (for contained responses).</p>

<p>You can find my changes in my <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/fastJSON">fastJSON fork</a> on GitHub. I also went ahead and organized the solution a bit, as the original source was a bit hard to get running. I also created a Nuget package for my changes and pushed that (<a href="https://nuget.org/packages/fastJSON-kayub">fastJSON-kayub</a>).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily intend to keep my changes in-sync. It would be preferable if my changes were pulled into the original&hellip; and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to use my new organization (since it&rsquo;s easy for others to pull down and build), but if that never happens, I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>

<h3>Note on Name Variance</h3>

<p>The name variance is interesting. In R#, the code was written to <code>yield return</code> each variant so as soon as one matches, it returns. In fastJSON, the matching is done in the opposite direction, fastJSON will try to match the JSON key to an object&rsquo;s properties&hellip; so it makes it difficult to use what R# had written originally. I modified the code to allow for optional variant matching to speed things up. Without that, the name variance increased deserialization time by <strong>a ton</strong>. However, in my case, I really only needed ProperCase matching&hellip; which only increases the time by about 2x.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I made the decision to opt-out of name variance by default and when enabled, only enable ProperCase by default as that&rsquo;s probably the most common.</p>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/62/renderroutes-expose-your-routes-to-your-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you&rsquo;re working on an AJAX-enabled application, you&rsquo;ll soon discover it can be a pain to manage URLs. In fact, when you&rsquo;re working with ASP.NET MVC in general, working with routes is a pain. As soon as you want to change one, you have to go and find everywhere it&rsquo;s used.</p>

<p>I came up with a solution that works well for me and may for you.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Are you writing code like this?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">url</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/products/&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">productId</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Wouldn&#39;t you rather write this?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">url</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;product&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">productId</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In MVC, you have the notion of &ldquo;named&rdquo; routes, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="n">routes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">RouteName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;product&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Url</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;product/{productId}&quot;</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(<em>Side Protip: <a href="http://kamranicus.com/Blog/Posts/23/mvc-pro-tip-dont-use-the-id-url-parameter-in-your">Don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;{id}&rdquo; in MVC routes</a></em>)</p>

<p>However, in the default MVC world, you would need to create these entries in your Global ASAX or wherever you set up your routes, and once you have enough, it will quickly get out of hand.</p>

<p>Awhile back, I started using <a href="http://attributerouting.net">AttributeRouting</a> to help organize my routing and remove the shackles of the default MVC routing experience. I even <a href="http://kamranayub.github.io/Blog/Posts/43/attributerouting-now-supports-web-api">contributed the first Web API implementation</a> to the project.</p>

<p>One of the bonuses of using AR is that it uses a standard interface for any routes it creates, <code>IAttributeRoute</code>. I knew that when I started using Web API more that I needed an easy way to bring my server-side routes to my client-side in a way that was easy to use and that I didn&rsquo;t need to manually maintain.</p>

<p>Thus was born my <code>RenderRoutes</code> extension:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4438411.js"></script>


<p>In order to use this properly in your Javascript, you&rsquo;ll need to create a helper utility. The one that I use is very simplistic, doing basic search and replace on parameters, which is the only thing I really need with my routes.</p>

<p>The dependencies my solution has are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://attributerouting.net">AttributeRouting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://underscorejs.org">Underscore.js</a></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s only because it was easier to leverage my existing dependencies. A more intrepid soul might be willing to de-couple my solution from these dependencies, and if you do, let me know so I can update my Gist. In fact, you should just fork my gist. Hmm, that sounds wrong.</p>

    <link href="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/61/a-smarter-checked-binding-for-knockoutjs"/>
    <updated>2012-12-31T09:48:04-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/61/a-smarter-checked-binding-for-knockoutjs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love KnockoutJS. I&rsquo;ve been using it for awhile now and I really enjoy it. That said, there are a few oddities with it, one such being the <code>checked</code> binding.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have this scenario (as I do now):</p>

<p>You want to <code>foreach</code> a list of items, each one having a checkbox. You want to store the checked items in a list, for use throughout the view model (bulk updates, select all, deselect all, etc.). How do you go about doing this?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; approach would be to add an observable property, <code>isSelected</code>, to each of your items. Then, in your markup, you can bind to that property:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;foreach: tasks&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;checkbox&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;checked: isSelected&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That is OK. It&rsquo;s OK because what if you need to use that item (assuming you&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or other reusable object) somewhere else where you don&rsquo;t need that property. You could just attach it where you need it. It also makes it a bit tricky to manage the list of selected items (you&rsquo;d probably end up creating a <code>computed</code> array), as well as making it difficult to dynamically bind a checkbox list to a computed array.</p>

<p>What you may decide to do (like me) is to try and bind the <code>checked</code> to your own observable array, and assign the <code>value</code> of the checkbox to a model property like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;checkbox&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;checked: $root.selectedTaskIds, value: id&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, if you do this, you&rsquo;ll soon discover a few oddities:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you check the checkbox, the <em>string</em> value of your model property will be placed into the array.</li>
<li>Your model property <em>will change to this new string value</em> essentially changing your original model.</li>
</ol>


<p>There are reasons for these two crazy happenings, which I discovered:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>checked</code> binding bases its value on the <em>element&rsquo;s</em> value, which is stored as a string.</li>
<li>The <code>value</code> binding keeps the property you are bound to and the <em>element&rsquo;s value</em> in-sync, which is why your model&rsquo;s ID becomes a string.</li>
</ol>


<p>It turns out, we&rsquo;re suffering from some mental model breakdown. If you look at the KO documentation for <code>checked</code>, it&rsquo;s easy to believe the above syntax should work, after all, it says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Special consideration is given if your parameter resolves to an array. In this case, KO will set the element to be checked if the <strong>value</strong> matches an item in the array, and unchecked if it is not contained in the array.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the <em>value</em> matches&hellip; &ldquo;Cool!&rdquo; so I can just bind the <code>value:</code> to my model property? NOPE. You&rsquo;ll run into the aforementioned issues if you try.</p>

<h3>Making a smarter <code>checked</code> binding</h3>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t want to add <code>isSelected</code> properties everywhere, I decided to &ldquo;monkey patch&rdquo; the <code>checked</code> and <code>value</code> bindings to play nice together.</p>

<p>Essentially, all my patch does is two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the <code>checked</code> binding, if it finds a <code>value</code> binding, it binds to that value rather than the element&rsquo;s value.</li>
<li>In the <code>value</code> binding, it completely ignores any changes if the <code>checked</code> binding is present, essentially nullifying the binding.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here are the new binding definitions:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4418574.js"></script>


<p>And you can see it in action here:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/G8YZU/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p>As you can see, now it works as you&rsquo;d expect! You can bind the <code>id</code> property to the list. You can also bind <code>$data</code> and you&rsquo;ll have the full object in your selected list.</p>

    <link href="http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/60/disappointed-in-the-windows-store-submission-proce"/>

    <id>http://kamranayub.github.io/blog/posts/60/disappointed-in-the-windows-store-submission-proce</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed I have to write about this, because I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;ve been a Microsoft-stack guy for a long time and I was <em>really</em> excited to release my <a href="http://steamhubapp.com">first app</a> for Windows 8. I&rsquo;m even more excited to also work on a Windows Phone app. That&rsquo;s why I bought a Surface RT and a new HTC 8X. I&rsquo;m all in.</p>

<p>So imagine my disappointment when, after five days, I receive this email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Windows Store: we couldn&rsquo;t certify your app</p></blockquote>

<p>Boo. <em>Okay,</em> I thought, <em>I must have missed something, no big deal.</em> Clearly the testers must have found something that I missed, since I ran my app through memory profiling and performance testing both on my PC and Surface. I even poured over the certification checklist and common points of failure. What did I miss?</p>

<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the tester&rsquo;s note said on the report:</p>

<blockquote><p>F:: It is unclear how to create an account for this app to be reviewed. This prevented us from completing our review of this app.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>What?</em> &ldquo;Unclear&rdquo;? You mean, the first sentence of my &ldquo;Instructions to Testers&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t clear enough?</p>

<blockquote><p>Please use my account (***) to test the app with.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>So. Frustrating.</em> I could understand if I had perhaps put that information at the bottom of my note, forgot to include it, or something else&hellip; but I <em>put it at the top of the instructions</em> to avoid this very problem. How can I feel confident in this testing process if the testers don&rsquo;t read our instructions? It just seems to contribute to my overall view that the Windows Store is lacking in several areas and &ldquo;just isn&rsquo;t there&rdquo; yet but I suppose that rant is for another day.</p>

<p>What makes it worse is that the tutorial video I include in the app (that is accessible on the first screen) <strong>uses my account to demo.</strong> It just boggles my mind.</p>

<p><img src="http://ragemaker.net/images/Stupidity/seriouslyChan.png" alt="Seriously?" /></p>

<p>The icing on the cake was that it took 5 days for this to fail. I&rsquo;m sure it goes into a queue and that the actual time to perform &ldquo;content compliance&rdquo; is an hour or so but even knowing that, it just made it worse since now I have to wait an additional X days for something I shouldn&rsquo;t have had to wait for in the first place.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else I can really do about it, though. I re-submitted it, I added extra emphasis in the Notes field, but what else is there? Just pray it works this time, I guess. Disappointing first-time experience, to say the least.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve done any serious Windows 8 development with WinJS, you&rsquo;ve probably come across this wall:</p>

<blockquote><p>I need to do some custom logic and data binding on this element and I wish I could just use <code>win-data-bind</code> to do it.</p></blockquote>

<p>In my case, all I wanted to do was toggle a CSS class based on my view model&rsquo;s property. In WinJS bindings, there is no way to call a custom binding converter with parameters nor can you access the DOM element from a converter, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Technically, you could call a function using <code>markSupportedForProcessing</code> and pass in these parameters, like this:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>But I am not sure that&rsquo;s a great idea (as the base.js source code has a lot of extra stuff around this method, which is why they expose an easier <code>WinJS.Binding.coverter</code>).</p>

<h2>Mix N&#8217; Match</h2>

<p>It turns out, it <em>seems</em> to be relatively straight-forward to make KO and WinJS work together. Why would you want to? Well, WinJS has a lot of useful features like WinJS.Promises, utilities, controls, templates, and lots of other stuff. You lose all that if you use a 3rd party library (like KO or jQuery) exclusively.</p>

<p>With this approach, you can choose what works best. You could go all out and use KO to bind all your stuff and then use WinJS for whatever else you need. I chose to just leverage the custom binding functionality.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s do it!</h2>

<p>Once you have Knockout installed (via Nuget or what have you), be sure it&rsquo;s included in your page:</p>

<p>I put it in default.html so it&rsquo;s globally accessible.</p>

<p>Now, all we are going to do is <strong>replace</strong> the call to <code>WinJS.Binding.processAll</code> with a function that intercepts the call and calls <code>ko.applyBindings</code>, then continues to call the built in WinJS function.</p>

<p>Create a new file, I named mine <em>*ko-winjs.js</em>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4183235.js?file=ko-winjs.js"></script>


<p>Then, just include this before <strong>default.js</strong> in your HTML file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>default.html
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;!-- WinJS references --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/css/ui-dark.css&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/base.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/ui.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/scripts/knockout-2.2.0.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/scripts/ko-winjs.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And you&rsquo;re all set! Now you can do this in your templates:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4183235.js?file=template.html"></script>


<p>Pretty awesome!</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I have no idea how inefficient this is, but my guess is that this adds extra processing time (plus, binding cache issues?). I have a small application so I&rsquo;m not too worried about it and it&rsquo;s the best thing I could come up with on short notice.</p>

<p>That said, if someone smarter than me and more familiar with KO and WinJS in general could take a peek at this&hellip; I&rsquo;d be super grateful, since I think this is a killer feature. If WinJS could just support KO-style binding syntax, I&rsquo;d be totally cool with that too!</p>
