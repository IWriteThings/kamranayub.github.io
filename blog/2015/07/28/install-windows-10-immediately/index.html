<p>This is only applicable for the next few hours until your machine gets Windows 10 rolled out. If you&rsquo;re inpatient like me, a friend tipped me off that he was able to install Windows 10 prematurely by simply forcing Windows Update to download Windows 10 and then setting his system time forward a day (BIOS, I&rsquo;m thinking).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of unbelievable but it&rsquo;s working so far. I&rsquo;m at 57% complete downloading (you can view in Windows Update window).</p>

<p>I will update this post with any new information.</p>
