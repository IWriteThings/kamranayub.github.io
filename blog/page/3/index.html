    <p>This comes directly from a tip <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/engjbw">Mike Zarandona posted on Coderwall</a>, which I&rsquo;m posting here to keep track of it:</p>

<p>I was sick of borrowing a friend&rsquo;s retina laptop to test retina images. After a little poking around, I discovered a few options baked right into the most popular browsers.</p>




<p>In Google Chrome:</p>




<ul>
<li>Browse to chrome://flags</li>
<li>Search for and enable Force high DPI mode</li>
</ul>




<p>In FireFox:</p>

<li>Browse to about:config</li>
<li>Search for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</li>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs">Debounced After Render Pattern for Knockout.js</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When dealing with Knockout-based lists, I think the built-in events/callbacks provided by Knockout leave a bit to be desired. For example, a common case I here people complain about is that the <code>afterRender</code> callback for the <code>foreach/template</code> bindings executes for each item in the array, not after all the elements have been rendered.</p>




<p>There are probably better ways to <em>resolve</em> this using Promises (pun intended), but here&rsquo;s one way to attack it using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-65">Underscore.js</a>&rsquo;s <code>debounce</code> method that&rsquo;s easy to understand and use.</p>




<p>The <code>debounce</code> method:</p>




<blockquote><p>Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for N milliseconds. If immediate is passed, trigger the function on the leading edge, instead of the trailing.</p></blockquote>




<p>This is useful for high-octane events like rendering elements, window resizing, or capture mouse events.</p>




<p>Here&rsquo;s a Fiddle that demonstrates a way to execute a callback after all the elements in a list have been rendered (and filters them to only <code>li</code> DOM elements):</p>




<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/yEhEt/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>This can be cleaned up multiple ways, I think a cleaner way to implement this would be through resolving a promise and then overriding the <code>foreach</code> and <code>template</code> binding to support it, for example, <code>afterAllRender</code> or something.</p>




<p>But this gets the job done and is easy to implement!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/73/slides-and-resources-for-tccc14-web-api-talk">Slides and Resources for TCCC14 Web API Talk</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I gave a talk this past weekend at Twin Cities Code Camp; it was my first public talk (hopefully the first of many?). It was a deep dive on selected ASP.NET Web API topics (as voted on by the audience) and you can view it on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kamranayub/diving-into-the-deep-wih-asp-dot-net">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>




<p>You can also <a href="http://sdrv.ms/ZgUuGI">download the notes</a> (i.e. links, comments, resources) from my SkyDrive.</p>




<p>If you were there and saw me present, <a href="http://spkr8.com/t/21961">please rate how I did</a>! It&rsquo;s the only way I really have of getting feedback.</p>




<h3>Thoughts</h3>




<p>I thought it went decent for my first talk. I was pretty nervous; I even forgot to say my name&hellip; but whatever! Hopefully by volunteering to do more talks I&rsquo;ll get the hang of it. All those business leadership classes paid off, my friends said that I didn&rsquo;t appear nervous, I projected my voice, and some folks were kind enough to say they liked it which is all I wanted. I also got the largest room right after lunch and it was probably 200 degrees. The Wi-Fi was deathly slow (&lt; 1Mbps) so that didn&rsquo;t help. Next time I&rsquo;ll plan to either take more screenshots or limit the online interaction.</p>




<p>I also think I had too many topics; I knew we couldn&rsquo;t get through all of them but one of my co-workers suggested to scale it down in order to hit specific topics and spend more time on each. It&rsquo;s so hard because they&rsquo;re all great topics to talk about&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even list content negotiation or automatic documentation.</p>




<p>Overall I was pleased with the outcome; I said what I wanted to say and it was a lot of fun.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Word documents on my computer that I&rsquo;ve had since I was a teen. I&rsquo;ve been keeping them all through my PC upgrades for no particular reason except for times like these when I need to laugh at myself.</p>




<p>I just found this nugget in some random debate outline, I was 13 when I wrote it (I had just started working in web design):</p>




<blockquote><p>Team work, in my opinion, not only involves working with your teammates, but working with your audience to find out what they want. What company does not ask their audience what they want? I don&rsquo;t think many do.</p></blockquote>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/71/anecdote-i-frustrate-easily">Anecdote: I Frustrate Easily</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When I first started my &ldquo;real job&rdquo; where I&rsquo;m at I was put on an internal site. It was a beast, it had a lot of history, and more importantly, it was <strong>damn ugly and sometimes hard to use</strong>. The site was used by developers and no one on the team had much UI experience. I was frustrated. I couldn&rsquo;t work on this thing and have it be ugly, why should we have a tool that gets used every day that&rsquo;s a bear to use? &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s always been that way&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me. For about a month I worked outside of work, off the sprint, and I re-tooled the CSS, markup, and UX while still maintaining the overall functionality and behavior. No one asked, I just did it <strong>because I was frustrated.</strong> Sure, at some points, people were sort of wondering what the heck I was doing but in the end, everyone loved the changes and everyone keeps mentioning how great the changes have been since. I believe it was also the start of a bigger push to make things easy to use internally but I suppose correlation does not equal causation :)</p>




<p>I think that&rsquo;s what <a href="http://zachholman.com/">Zach Holman</a> means when he says to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/holman/keeping-people?slide=31">hire people who frustrate easily</a> and that&rsquo;s what triggered this anecdote.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/70/protip-using-anti-forgery-token-with-aspnet-web-ap">Protip: Using Anti-Forgery Token With ASP.NET Web API on MVC 4 on AppHarbor</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I just ran into and solved this problem so I thought I&rsquo;d share (I&rsquo;ll also be talking about this at my upcoming talk).</p>




<h3>Anti-Forgery in MVC</h3>




<p>In vanilla MVC, you&rsquo;d do anti-forgery like this in your Razor view:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Then in a controller (POST):</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="na">[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Cool. But what about Web API? It uses a totally different pipeline and likely you&rsquo;re interacting with it via JQuery or other AJAX framework.</p>




<h3>ValidateHttpAntiForgeryToken</h3>




<p>Here are some references I used when trying to implement Anti-Forgery with Web API:</p>




<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11725988/problems-implementing-validatingantiforgerytoken-attribute-for-web-api-with-mvc">Problems implementing ValidatingAntiForgeryToken attribute for Web API with MVC 4 RC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11476883/web-api-and-validateantiforgerytoken">Web API and ValidateAntiForgeryToken</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-(csrf">Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks</a>-attacks)</li>
<li>MVC 4 SPA template</li>
</ul>




<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub: the two SO posts above implement this quite differently than the MVC 4 SPA template and the last article referenced. Both approaches actually worked locally for me, but both failed once I deployed to AppHarbor.</p>




<p>The long and short of it is that I was using the HTTP header <code>__RequestVerificationToken</code>. This is a no-no and I&rsquo;m sort of the dumb one here in that I should <em>know</em> not to use custom headers like that.</p>




<p>My friends, the <em>proper</em> way is to use the <code>X-*</code> convention, so the HTTP header in your AJAX requests become <code>X-XSRF-Token</code> instead.</p>




<p>Apparently, AppHarbor was stripping off the other header on AJAX POST. I was receiving an error about the given header could not be found.</p>




<p>The working solution is below:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/5449779.js"></script>




<p>The <code>machineKey</code> thing is also key to remember on a cloud host/web farm environment.</p>




<p>I hope that helps somebody out there.</p>




<h3>Aside</h3>




<p>In the last article referenced, the <code>AntiForgery.GetTokens()</code> didn&rsquo;t work for me on AH. I kept getting the error:</p>




<pre><code>System.Web.Mvc.HttpAntiForgeryException (0x80004005): The required anti-forgery cookie "__RequestVerificationToken" is not present.
</code></pre>




<p>I didn&rsquo;t get far enough to see what actual cookies were present because I switched to the other method outlined in the two SO posts. I just thought you should know that it just didn&rsquo;t work. I believe it&rsquo;s because <code>GetTokens</code> does not create a new cookie if the <code>cookieToken</code> has a value where as using <code>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()</code> does. The <a href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/9a83b63f3f889e3f2c979274fe3e8f7610e06b98#src/System.Web.WebPages/Helpers/AntiXsrf/AntiForgeryWorker.cs">source code</a> makes that clear in the comments. Why it worked locally I have no idea and at this point, don&rsquo;t care!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/69/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-wor">Put the Cloud to Work, Pt 1: Create a Background Worker Using Quartz.NET</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve written a [long] article for Tech.pro on <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1222/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-worker-using-quartznet">how to use Quartz.NET to build an end-to-end background worker on AppHarbor</a>.</p>




<p>I plan to write a couple more follow-ups about more advanced usage of Quartz with a pretty big finale (I don&rsquo;t want to get anyone&rsquo;s hopes up though).</p>




<p>Some fun stats:</p>




<ul>
<li>~5300 words</li>
<li>~40 hours of work</li>
<li>~40 pages in PDF</li>
</ul>




<p>It seems longer than it is; most of it is code snippets and pictures but it takes about 20 minutes to read and about 45-60 minutes to work through (follow along).</p>




<p>I marked it as a Beginner tutorial and as such went into a lot of detail I wouldn&rsquo;t normally spend time on if it was just a blog post. I find writing formal articles forces me to verify what I know (or I think I know), explore alternatives, and do a deep-dive into whatever topic I want to talk about. It&rsquo;s mostly driven by fear: fear of being wrong, fear of being humiliated, fear of what other people think. Writing about a topic forces you to learn about things you maybe thought you knew but didn&rsquo;t really. I also believe it helps you become better at teaching others; if you can&rsquo;t explain what you know, do you really know it? At it&rsquo;s core, it&rsquo;s just good exercise!</p>




<p>I chose tech.pro because I like what they&rsquo;re trying to do, I like that they&rsquo;re open with development, and I also like the cash prize if your article is the top in its category ($1000). I also like that they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; your content; you&rsquo;re free to post it to other venues and it&rsquo;s your own work. I think it already has some great tutorials, including ones by someone I follow regularly, <a href="http://tech.pro/filipw/blog">Filip W</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/68/upcoming-events-rwd-workshop-code-camp-and-dotnetc">Upcoming Events: RWD Workshop, Code Camp, and dotNetConf [Updated]</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Just a quick set of FYIs. I will be attending 3 upcoming events, two in-person and one virtually.</p>




<h3>RWD Workshop with Tim Kadlec</h3>




<p><a href="http://timkadlec.com">Tim Kadlec</a> is a cool guy; he&rsquo;s also one of the RWD gurus and has lots to share. He&rsquo;s <a href="http://timkadlec.com/2013/04/implementing-responsive-design-workshop/">hosting a 30 person workshop</a> at the U of MN, so it&rsquo;ll be a small group of people that will be sharing RWD experiences. I&rsquo;m attending, and if prodded, I will share my experience implementing RWD on some big sites (hint: it&rsquo;s challenging).</p>




<h3>Code Camp</h3>




<p><a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a> is a free conference put together by local volunteers and is a great event to go to if you like to see people&rsquo;s code or share your own. I will be <a href="/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">talking about Web API</a> and opening up my closed-source project (Keep Track of My Games v2) for all to see. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting, for sure.</p>




<h3>dotNetConf</h3>




<p><a href="http://dotnetconf.net">dotNetConf</a> is a free virtual conference on all things .NET. I&rsquo;ll be attending a couple sessions at least and there&rsquo;s nothing to lose by attending. Be sure to check it out!</p>




<h3>Hack for MN</h3>




<p><a href="http://hackformn.eventbrite.com/">HackForMN</a> is for the National Day of Civic Hacking but for us Minnesotans. A handful of friends are going and I think there&rsquo;s probably a good app or two for The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes worth making.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/67/ive-released-my-first-windows-phone-app-centwise">I&#8217;ve Released My First Windows Phone App: Centwise</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m excited to talk about my latest project that just went live a couple weeks ago: <a href="http://centwiseapp.com">Centwise</a>. Centwise is a Windows Phone 7 &amp; 8 app client for a service that I use regularly, <a href="http://splitwise.com">Splitwise</a>.</p>




<p>You can download the app to your Windows Phone below:</p>




<p><a href="http://bit.ly/getcentwise"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/410b39b16d0c759db1cbda923e968f91/tumblr_inline_mjvfbsUlMF1qz4rgp.png" alt="Get the app" /></a></p>




<h2>What&rsquo;s Splitwise?</h2>




<p><a href="http://splitwise.com">Splitwise</a> is a web app that lets you manage IOUs and bill splitting. I use it day-to-day during outings with friends but mainly I use it to keep track of bills and household expenses between me, my fiancee, and our roommate. It&rsquo;s a great tool and they provide native apps for iOS and Android. When I started Centwise, they didn&rsquo;t have a WP app and I figured as an avid user of the service, my first app could be a Splitwise client.</p>




<p>I really want to thank the Splitwise team (Jon &amp; Ryan!) for helping me out, answering questions, and for mentioning Centwise on their blog.</p>




<h2>First app experience</h2>




<p>I bought a HTC 8X when it was announced on Verizon day one. I knew I wanted to leave my old Droid Incredible in the dust and move on to greener pastures. Being a Microsoft stack guy, I figured Windows Phone would be good not only because I like the interface and experience but also because I could make some apps for the platform.</p>




<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked with WPF and XAML before, so learning the ins and outs of the pared-down Silverlight for Windows Phone wasn&rsquo;t too terrible but there were certainly roadblocks. I&rsquo;ve tried to bookmark every article or post I came across that helped me out, which I&rsquo;ll share at the end. Coming from a primarily web-based focus to a native XAML/C# platform was certainly jarring and there were times I slammed my hands on the keyboard exclaiming, &ldquo;THIS WOULD BE WAY EASIER IN CSS AND HTML!&rdquo; Like making a transparent button, for example.</p>




<p>I hope to go more in detail with certain issues as well as share some tips and tricks I learned along my journey to building my first app. There can be a lot of crazy things you wouldn&rsquo;t know XAML can do if you didn&rsquo;t spend time deconstructing bigger open-source libraries (which I <em>highly</em> recommend, I often kept <a href="http://phone.codeplex.com">Phone Toolkit</a> open alongside my own app to see how they built controls).</p>




<h2>The beginnings</h2>




<p>All apps have a beginning. Mine began on paper using the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaeldorian/5071511857/">excellent paper templates</a> provided by Michael Bach.</p>




<p>Here are the paper sketches I made that helped me form the screens for the app. I spent most of my time sketching the more complex pages, the ones that needed to do or show a lot of stuff but where I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.</p>

<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136893&authkey=AEr0Ed2bQzMJx54" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136894&authkey=APrH1Wua6J8fLJU" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<p>I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to do these types of sketches to help me visualize the UI. It also helps me see immediately whether or not my idea makes sense.</p>




<p>From there, I could start working on the XAML and the screens to put my ideas into the app. However, as you&rsquo;ll soon see, my first ideas usually weren&rsquo;t the best.</p>




<h2>Optimizing the UX</h2>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136892&authkey=ACGYGiJBJeURBfk" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<p>If you look at the first image, you can see that my initial idea when creating expenses was to display a list of people to choose from. In fact, pre-1.0 that is exactly what I had done. The flow looked like this:</p>




<ol>
<li>User specifies &ldquo;Create an IOU&rdquo;</li>
<li>User chooses other person or chooses from address book</li>
<li>User is shown IOU screen</li>
</ol>




<p>This was pretty straightforward&hellip; after all, there are only 3 steps. But that was one step too many. It also ended up complicating my code quite a bit due to managing the back stack (i.e. what happens when a user cancels or hits &lsquo;Back&rsquo;).</p>




<p>In the final 1.0 release, I changed it to be easier and faster:</p>




<ol>
<li>User chooses to create an IOU</li>
<li>User is shown screen and either a) the other person is already populated or b) user can tap the avatar placeholder to choose someone</li>
</ol>




<p>That&rsquo;s just one example of a change I had made that was different from my first implementation.</p>




<p>If you take a look at the second set of sketches, you can see I drastically changed how the IOU (and other) screens were laid out.</p>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136893&authkey=AEr0Ed2bQzMJx54" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136609&authkey=AOWlC2tQqkFVW_A" width="180" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<p>Here are just some of the changes I made:</p>




<ol>
<li>Instead of a button, I created a <code>CalculatorTextBox</code> that combines a calculator and amount textbox into one.</li>
<li>This was huge because it also greatly simplified the UI of the Divide a Bill screen</li>
<li>Moved the currency button to the appbar menu items because it&rsquo;s not something a user will typically use often.</li>
<li>Made the static arrow shown between avatars a button to easily swap people in case the user made a mistake</li>
</ol>




<h2>Easy but not simple</h2>




<p>Someone wise once said:</p>




<blockquote><p>Making things easy is <em>hard</em>.</p></blockquote>




<p>That&rsquo;s been true with everything I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure to work on. Easy is hard.</p>




<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any formal beta testers, mainly because the Windows Phone Dev Center didn&rsquo;t let me (<em>sigh</em>), but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from showing it to friends and family to have them test it out.</p>




<p>The core implementation of the app is pretty simple&hellip; it&rsquo;s all the extra work I had to put in to make the <em>app</em> simple that wasn&rsquo;t easy. Not only was it my first time trying to learn Windows Phone development, I also have a tendency to spend a lot of time on little things.</p>




<iframe src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=0E21D632E0E57AEE&resid=E21D632E0E57AEE%2136736&authkey=AI7_LBxzEW-9MkM" width="180" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>




<p>For example, let&rsquo;s consider the &ldquo;people picker&rdquo; functionality. When a user wants to choose people to add to the expense, there&rsquo;s more logic than simply &ldquo;show the user&rsquo;s friends&rdquo;. The control actually does several things:</p>




<ol>
<li>If the user adds an expense type in the context of a group, then the picker shows the people in that group first.</li>
<li>If the user divides a bill from the home screen, the picker shows available groups which:</li>
<li>Automatically adds all the people in that group to the bill</li>
<li>Sets the &ldquo;filed in&rdquo; value to the group they chose, regardless of the context the user was in (home screen vs. group)</li>
<li>Makes sure not to show people already added to the expense</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s the user choose someone from the address book (but not for payments!)</li>
</ol>




<p>I use this people picker anywhere I need to, including when creating a group. By reusing the same experience, the user never has to learn a new way of picking people.</p>




<p>There&rsquo;s just a ton of little things like that throughout the app that the user probably won&rsquo;t ever notice but I hope surfaces in the form of, &ldquo;Hey, this is easy to use!&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want the app to get in the way of the user doing whatever they needed to do.</p>




<p>I cannot count the amount of hours I&rsquo;ve spent so far, although I tried to keep track at first but once I hit 60+ hours in less than a week, I stopped. Luckily, GitHub has a great visualization of how often I worked the app:</p>




<p><strong>Commit Activity</strong></p>




<p><img src="/blog/images/72.png" alt="I am insane" /></p>




<p>Let me break it down for you: I am insane.</p>




<p><img src="/blog/images/73.png" alt="Seriously, insane" /></p>




<p>You can forgive me if I plan to take it a bit slower with updates. I was hoping to finish in time for the Next App Star challenge but unfortunately even spending countless hours during the week, the app just wasn&rsquo;t in a good state in time for that deadline.</p>




<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>




<p>I hope to go into more technical detail around some of the things I did with my app at a later point. I was really excited to learn how to build a Windows Phone app and am very pleased with the result. I didn&rsquo;t build it expecting to make thousands of dollars; I&rsquo;ll be lucky (and happy) if I break $500 but making it a paid-for app motivates me as a single developer to keep the app up-to-date and full of useful features. I have personal projects and open projects that eat up time that I need to make sure I can support each one of them.</p>




<p>As far as what I have planned, you can keep tabs on <a href="http://centwiseapp.com">CentwiseApp.com</a> or follow Centwise on <a href="http://twitter.com/centwiseapp">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com/centwise">Facebook</a>. I hope to do a UI refresh soon and I have about 20+ enhancements to incrementally add. I already released the <a href="http://centwiseapp.com/post/46850512483/update-v1-1-will-be-available-today">1.1 update</a> that added several new features, so that&rsquo;s a good start!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">About My Web API Session at Twin Cities Code Camp</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><strong>Update:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be in the 12:45pm track, come see me crash and burn!</p>




<p>Yay! I was just informed by TCCC that I&rsquo;ve made it onto the <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Spring2013/Sessions.aspx#s22">Sessions list</a> so I guess I&rsquo;m officially a speaker. This would be the very first time I&rsquo;m giving a public talk <em>on my own</em>. I was part of a session at MinneWebCon when I spoke about my work on the Student Unions &amp; Activities touch-screen directory, so I have <em>at least</em> 15 minutes under my belt.</p>




<h3>Session? Or Presentation?</h3>




<p>Presentation is a strong and loaded word. It brings to mind a boring PowerPoint slideshow of stuff no one ever reads. It brings to mind a stale &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk at you&rdquo; type of feeling, where the &ldquo;participants&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t actually participating.</p>




<p>No, my session at TCCC is not like that. I did a 20 minute version of the session at work and it went well, though I didn&rsquo;t have much time to dive into real code, which is definitely what I plan to do at TCCC&hellip; after all, it is a <strong>code camp</strong>. I will be showing some information about the topics I cover but other than that, we will be diving into the bowels of my app&hellip; for better or worse.</p>




<h3>ASP.NET Web API: What now?</h3>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Web API for a bit, it&rsquo;ll be a core part of the next <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>. In fact, the beta version of KTOMG will be what I will use to demo all my code and ideas.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on it. I&rsquo;m not even &ldquo;great&rdquo; at it. I&rsquo;m just a regular developer who is using it on a real project and I&rsquo;ve run into &ldquo;real&rdquo; issues. The main reason I wanted to do a session on Web API is because of a few reasons:</p>




<ol>
<li>Web API is awesome and everyone should know about it</li>
<li>Some things aren&rsquo;t apparent when you&rsquo;re starting out doing API development</li>
<li>Most presentations on Web API are cursory overviews</li>
<li>It can be hard to know what the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do things is</li>
</ol>




<p>Regarding #4, this is a hard thing to talk about&hellip; since I still don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;what the right way&rdquo; is and I think it depends on your situation. However, at the very least, I can tell you <em>what I did</em> and <em>what works for me</em> and maybe you can leave the session with a better idea of what it is you want to do.</p>




<h3>So what&rsquo;s on the agenda?</h3>




<p>Lots of stuff, and I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t get to a lot of it:</p>




<ul>
<li>Debugging tips</li>
<li>CSRF prevention</li>
<li>Custom routing (w/client-side)</li>
<li>Custom error handling</li>
<li>Integration with the client-side</li>
<li>Working with multiple clients (phone, Windows 8, etc.)</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Async actions</li>
</ul>




<p>There&rsquo;ll be plenty to show and plenty more to discuss. I&rsquo;m more interested in seeing what others have done or would recommend.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited, so I&rsquo;ll see you April 27!</p>
