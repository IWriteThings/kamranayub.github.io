  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/05/01/ludum-dare-29-game-jam-success/">Ludum Dare 29 Game Jam Success!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>This last weekend I spent 72 hours working on a game for the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo">Ludum Dare 29</a> game jam. LD is a competition where you get a prompt for a game and then have to spend 48 hours (solo) or 72 hours (jam) and bang out a game. The solo competition has strict rules but the game jam has looser rules and allows for team development. It was a caffeine-filled rush and I hope to write a blog post shortly about how it all went down. It was a ton of fun! I worked with my friends <a href="http://erikonarheim.com">Erik Onarheim</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/joshedeen">Josh Edeen</a>, both primary contributors to the <a href="http://excaliburjs.com">Excalibur.js</a> game engine. I am also a contributor but I haven&rsquo;t done a ton with the engine core, moreso the usability of the API, opening GH issues, and the <a href="http://github.com/excaliburjs/excaliburjs.github.io">website</a>.</p>




<p><img src="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/342546/34118-shot0.png" alt="Kraken Unchained" /></p>




<p>In the meantime, be sure to check out the fruits of our labor! It&rsquo;s a game where you play as the Kraken and you destroy ships. We originally had a ton of ideas, as you can see in our GitHub repository, but with only 72 hours your scope is pretty narrow. Still, we&rsquo;re very happy with what came out and we&rsquo;re glad that <a href="http://excaliburjs.com">Excalibur.js</a> pulled through!</p>




<p>Play <a href="http://krakenunchained.azurewebsites.net">Kraken Unchained</a>. Vote for it on the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&amp;uid=34118">LD site</a>. You can also take a peek at the <a href="http://krakenunchained.azurewebsites.net/post-dare.html">post-LD</a> version which is in on-going development. It does support touch and fixes some issues in IE10/11.</p>




<p>You can also view the entirety of the source code <a href="http://github.com/excaliburjs/ludum-29">on GitHub</a>!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/02/09/websockets-on-windows-azure/">Getting WebSockets to Work on Windows Azure</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I was banging my head against the wall for the past hour or so wondering why I was falling back to XHR polling when I deployed my Node.js application to Azure. I&rsquo;m using socket.io and everything looks like it&rsquo;s in order, works locally, etc. It was failing with a WebSocket handshake error.</p>




<p>What I saw in the Chrome developer console was something like:</p>




<pre><code>Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 502
</code></pre>




<p>In my Azure Node.js console (<code>azure site log tail SITENAME</code>), I was seeing <code>EPIPE</code> errors.</p>




<p>It turns out, this little tidbit from the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2013/11/14/introduction-to-websockets-on-windows-azure-web-sites.aspx">original Windows Azure blog post</a> on Web Sockets did the trick.</p>




<p>Modify your <strong>web.config</strong> and add:</p>




<pre><code>&lt;webSocket enabled="false" /&gt;
</code></pre>




<p>To your <code>system.webServer</code> configuration. Also, another good point in that blog post is to use SSL, since you get SSL for free with a <code>*.azurewebsites.net</code> site.</p>




<p>Hope this helps someone else out there. This should be added to the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-chat-app-socketio/">official Azure tutorial</a> on using web sockets with Node.js.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/29/5-tips-to-improve-your-mvc-site/">5 Tips to Improve Your ASP.NET MVC Codebase</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I have an urge to write a quick list of tips for improving an ASP.NET MVC application because
I just got done reviewing some code for a support ticket at work. It&rsquo;s still fresh
in my mind and I wanted to get some of my thoughts down to share with others. If you
have been doing MVC for a while, I don&rsquo;t think much of this is news. It&rsquo;s more
for those of you that don&rsquo;t do MVC often or are new to MVC.</p>

It&rsquo;s a tiny, tiny app that only took me a couple hours to build. You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/HaveIBeenPwned">GitHub</a>.</p>




<p><a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a> is a website created by <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a>, a security MVP, that checks to see if your email address appears in a database of all the breached email addresses in prominent hacks like Gawker, Sony, and Adobe. I&rsquo;ve definitely been pwned, so it&rsquo;s a good service to use to quickly see if you need to change your passwords.</p>




<p>I plan to add the background task soon but I wanted the initial release out there so that I can just submit updates to it. If you want to contribute, send me a pull request!</p>

    <p>I just published an article on Tech.pro that <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1749/get-your-ci-on-with-travis-ci">walks through getting started with Travis CI</a>. We use it for Excalibur.js and that was my first

for open source projects.</p>

<p>I just released my second Windows Phone app, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/bowling-calculator/9287a99a-6068-4ff4-925b-988c8c99dbf6">Bowling Calculator</a>. It&rsquo;s an <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">open source app</a> that I created when <a href="/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">I gave my talk at TCCC15</a>.
If you&rsquo;re a fellow developer, feel free to send me a pull request with any bug fixes or enhancements. I want to keep it focused on
the simple use case of scoring a bowling game; I don&rsquo;t need it to track multiple games or keep track of history. It&rsquo;s purpose is to serve
as a production-ready sample app and to also be good at what it aims to do.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve just pushed a new version of Kamranicus that is built using the static site generator, <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. Octopress uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate static sites.</p>




<p>I decided to switch because I can leverage GitHub Pages which are <strong>free</strong> and I can use a custom domain. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit because I can just piggyback on GitHub&rsquo;s cloud hosting for free and not worry about incurring any downtime due to database issues (something that happened more than a few times with the last ASP.NET MVC and SQL-based site).</p>




<p>I really enjoyed setting up Octopress, it was easy to migrate my posts. I highly recommend it! It would be even better to have a .NET/C#-based static site generator that supported all of Jekyll&rsquo;s configuration options, except with Razor-based layouts and templating. Mmmm, that sounds pretty good. Someone get on that.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/79/just-pushed-blackjack-sample-game">Just Pushed: Blackjack Sample Game</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s finally done! I sat down today and dug through my backups to find my original WPF BlackJack game I wrote way back when WPF was really cool. I converted it to VS 2013, made sure it still ran, organized the solution, and hit deploy. It&rsquo;s now up on GitHub for your learning pleasure. There are no Nuget packages here! This was before Nuget where I had to find code to learn from and, ahem, copy. The deck is also something I found online. If I find the source, I&rsquo;ll be sure to attribute it properly.</p>




<p><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/">https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/</a></p>




<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/5122176" width="500" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>




<p>This was a sample game I wrote to learn OO design and WPF. There&rsquo;s some cool animations, sound effects, and a pretty fun Blackjack implementation. It&rsquo;s very &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and should be easy to digest. I never got around to implementing all the cool AI but now that it&rsquo;s on GitHub for all to see, maybe someone will pick it up.</p>




<p>I also think it&rsquo;d be fun to port it to Windows 8 C# and XAML. It could be an app I release on the store, free and open source.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Well, that was a blast. Yesterday was <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">TCCC15</a> and it was great. Many awesome sessions, including several by my fellow co-workers <a href="http://twitter.com/ErikOnarhem">Erik Onarheim</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenErstad">Stephen Erstad</a>.</p>




<p>Thanks to all who attended <a href="/Blog/Posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">my talk</a>! I got +10 votes on the code camp speaker site and 9 llamas, which made me feel pretty good!</p>




<p>Please send me feedback at my email or leave a comment here with your thoughts. The code will be available (soon) at <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling</a>. It&rsquo;ll be released under an open license but is meant to be educational. The app will also be available soon in the Windows Phone store.</p>




<p>If you missed my talk, you can still get all the bits once I release the app on GitHub. Sure, there won&rsquo;t be droning voice over the code, but you can still see all the steps I took to enhance it.</p>




<p>There was only one big hiccup where Nuget would not install a package, even when I had it in my local repository (it installed the other ones). I remembered some time ago Scott Hanselman mentioning that Nuget packages were just zip files. I quickly changed my Nuget package extension (because I didn&rsquo;t have Nuget Package Explorer installed), got the DLL, and added it as a project reference to quickly save my skin. Thanks Scott!</p>
