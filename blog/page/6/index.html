  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">About My Web API Session at Twin Cities Code Camp</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><strong>Update:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be in the 12:45pm track, come see me crash and burn!</p>




<p>Yay! I was just informed by TCCC that I&rsquo;ve made it onto the <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Spring2013/Sessions.aspx#s22">Sessions list</a> so I guess I&rsquo;m officially a speaker. This would be the very first time I&rsquo;m giving a public talk <em>on my own</em>. I was part of a session at MinneWebCon when I spoke about my work on the Student Unions &amp; Activities touch-screen directory, so I have <em>at least</em> 15 minutes under my belt.</p>




<h3>Session? Or Presentation?</h3>




<p>Presentation is a strong and loaded word. It brings to mind a boring PowerPoint slideshow of stuff no one ever reads. It brings to mind a stale &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk at you&rdquo; type of feeling, where the &ldquo;participants&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t actually participating.</p>




<p>No, my session at TCCC is not like that. I did a 20 minute version of the session at work and it went well, though I didn&rsquo;t have much time to dive into real code, which is definitely what I plan to do at TCCC&hellip; after all, it is a <strong>code camp</strong>. I will be showing some information about the topics I cover but other than that, we will be diving into the bowels of my app&hellip; for better or worse.</p>




<h3>ASP.NET Web API: What now?</h3>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Web API for a bit, it&rsquo;ll be a core part of the next <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>. In fact, the beta version of KTOMG will be what I will use to demo all my code and ideas.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on it. I&rsquo;m not even &ldquo;great&rdquo; at it. I&rsquo;m just a regular developer who is using it on a real project and I&rsquo;ve run into &ldquo;real&rdquo; issues. The main reason I wanted to do a session on Web API is because of a few reasons:</p>




<ol>
<li>Web API is awesome and everyone should know about it</li>
<li>Some things aren&rsquo;t apparent when you&rsquo;re starting out doing API development</li>
<li>Most presentations on Web API are cursory overviews</li>
<li>It can be hard to know what the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do things is</li>
</ol>




<p>Regarding #4, this is a hard thing to talk about&hellip; since I still don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;what the right way&rdquo; is and I think it depends on your situation. However, at the very least, I can tell you <em>what I did</em> and <em>what works for me</em> and maybe you can leave the session with a better idea of what it is you want to do.</p>




<h3>So what&rsquo;s on the agenda?</h3>




<p>Lots of stuff, and I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t get to a lot of it:</p>




<ul>
<li>Debugging tips</li>
<li>CSRF prevention</li>
<li>Custom routing (w/client-side)</li>
<li>Custom error handling</li>
<li>Integration with the client-side</li>
<li>Working with multiple clients (phone, Windows 8, etc.)</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Async actions</li>
</ul>




<p>There&rsquo;ll be plenty to show and plenty more to discuss. I&rsquo;m more interested in seeing what others have done or would recommend.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited, so I&rsquo;ll see you April 27!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/64/bindableappbar-for-caliburn-micro">BindableAppBar for Caliburn Micro</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><strong>Update:</strong> Matteo Pagani has a <a href="http://wp.qmatteoq.com/first-steps-with-caliburn-micro-the-application-bar/">great introduction</a> on setting up the BindableAppBar. Thanks Matteo!</p>




<p>Anyone who has done Windows Phone development will tell you: the appbar sucks.</p>




<p>It sucks for several reasons:</p>




<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a <code>DependencyObject</code> so you can&rsquo;t use binding</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t support commands</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to make it dynamic because it must be maniuplated in code</li>
<li>It sucks</li>
</ul>




<p>Given those reasons, it&rsquo;s no surprise people have come up with &ldquo;bindable app bars&rdquo; that are basically wrappers around the appbar that allow binding, manipulation, and such.</p>




<p>Unfortunately, none of those solutions have come to Caliburn. Caliburn <em>does</em> provide basic message binding support and IsEnabled guarding, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>




<p>So, given that I <strong>really</strong> wanted to start binding some appbars hardcore, I decided to spend a day and make it happen.</p>




<p><strong>Introducing the Caliburn.Micro.BindableAppBar</strong>: you can enjoy the fruits of my labor on <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Caliburn.Micro.BindableAppBar/">Nuget</a> or at the <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/CaliburnBindableAppBar">GitHub</a> repository. Here&rsquo;s hoping Rob brings this into core so it&rsquo;ll just &ldquo;be there&rdquo; and integrated more into the overall Caliburn system.</p>




<p>The big benefit is the ability to easily use multiple appbars on a single view <strong>and</strong> in conducted Pivot/Panorama views. In my case, I do both, because one pivot page has two states (a selection state and a browsing state) and both requires two different appbars. The other pivot page doesn&rsquo;t need all the cruft of the first pivot&rsquo;s appbar, so only one button is present on it.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/65/i-forked-fastjson">I Forked fastJSON</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>My Windows Phone app mainly deals with talking to a web API. I&rsquo;ve previously had good experience using RestSharp but now with the new <code>async/await</code> features, I&rsquo;ve been trying to only use <code>Task</code>-based stuff. I gotta say, I&rsquo;m loving it.</p>




<p>RestSharp for WP does not natively support async/await but you can wrap it yourself. However, why not just use <code>HttpClient</code>? So that&rsquo;s what I did. I ripped out RestSharp and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/neuecc/AsyncOAuth">AsyncOAuth</a> (which depends on HttpClient).</p>




<p>Besides OAuth, the other issue you&rsquo;ll run into is what serializer/deserializer to use. You could go with JSON.NET, or ServiceStack, but those are two extremes&hellip; one being very flexible and other being very inflexible. I needed an in-between but also something very fast and that&rsquo;s exactly what <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/159450/fastJSON">fastJSON</a> is.</p>




<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s fast because of the same reason SS is fast: it doesn&rsquo;t do any fancy property matching. When you&rsquo;re dealing with APIs, it&rsquo;s rare that the response they send back matches exactly with your object model and properties (especially C#). That&rsquo;s why the name variance feature of the larger libraries is awesome.</p>




<p>So, I did what any good developer would, I dug in and added it. I also added <code>rootElement</code> support (for contained responses).</p>




<p>You can find my changes in my <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/fastJSON">fastJSON fork</a> on GitHub. I also went ahead and organized the solution a bit, as the original source was a bit hard to get running. I also created a Nuget package for my changes and pushed that (<a href="https://nuget.org/packages/fastJSON-kayub">fastJSON-kayub</a>).</p>




<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily intend to keep my changes in-sync. It would be preferable if my changes were pulled into the original&hellip; and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to use my new organization (since it&rsquo;s easy for others to pull down and build), but if that never happens, I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>




<h3>Note on Name Variance</h3>




<p>The name variance is interesting. In R#, the code was written to <code>yield return</code> each variant so as soon as one matches, it returns. In fastJSON, the matching is done in the opposite direction, fastJSON will try to match the JSON key to an object&rsquo;s properties&hellip; so it makes it difficult to use what R# had written originally. I modified the code to allow for optional variant matching to speed things up. Without that, the name variance increased deserialization time by <strong>a ton</strong>. However, in my case, I really only needed ProperCase matching&hellip; which only increases the time by about 2x.</p>




<p>That&rsquo;s why I made the decision to opt-out of name variance by default and when enabled, only enable ProperCase by default as that&rsquo;s probably the most common.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/62/renderroutes-expose-your-routes-to-your-javascript">RenderRoutes: Expose Your Routes to Your Javascript</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re working on an AJAX-enabled application, you&rsquo;ll soon discover it can be a pain to manage URLs. In fact, when you&rsquo;re working with ASP.NET MVC in general, working with routes is a pain. As soon as you want to change one, you have to go and find everywhere it&rsquo;s used.</p>




<p>I came up with a solution that works well for me and may for you.</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Are you writing code like this?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">url</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/products/&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">productId</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Wouldn&#39;t you rather write this?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">url</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;product&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">productId</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>In MVC, you have the notion of &ldquo;named&rdquo; routes, like this:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="n">routes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">RouteName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;product&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Url</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;product/{productId}&quot;</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>(<em>Side Protip: <a href="http://kamranicus.com/Blog/Posts/23/mvc-pro-tip-dont-use-the-id-url-parameter-in-your">Don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;{id}&rdquo; in MVC routes</a></em>)</p>




<p>However, in the default MVC world, you would need to create these entries in your Global ASAX or wherever you set up your routes, and once you have enough, it will quickly get out of hand.</p>




<p>Awhile back, I started using <a href="http://attributerouting.net">AttributeRouting</a> to help organize my routing and remove the shackles of the default MVC routing experience. I even <a href="/Blog/Posts/43/attributerouting-now-supports-web-api">contributed the first Web API implementation</a> to the project.</p>




<p>One of the bonuses of using AR is that it uses a standard interface for any routes it creates, <code>IAttributeRoute</code>. I knew that when I started using Web API more that I needed an easy way to bring my server-side routes to my client-side in a way that was easy to use and that I didn&rsquo;t need to manually maintain.</p>




<p>Thus was born my <code>RenderRoutes</code> extension:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/4438411.js"></script>




<p>In order to use this properly in your Javascript, you&rsquo;ll need to create a helper utility. The one that I use is very simplistic, doing basic search and replace on parameters, which is the only thing I really need with my routes.</p>




<p>The dependencies my solution has are:</p>




<ul>
<li><a href="http://attributerouting.net">AttributeRouting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://underscorejs.org">Underscore.js</a></li>
</ul>




<p>That&rsquo;s only because it was easier to leverage my existing dependencies. A more intrepid soul might be willing to de-couple my solution from these dependencies, and if you do, let me know so I can update my Gist. In fact, you should just fork my gist. Hmm, that sounds wrong.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/61/a-smarter-checked-binding-for-knockoutjs">A Smarter `checked` Binding for KnockoutJS</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <blockquote><p><strong>Update</strong>: In Knockout 3+, this issue is solved with the new <code>checkedValue</code> binding. Read the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/checked-binding.html">documentation</a> for details. You can still use my workaround for KO 2.x and below.</p></blockquote>




<p>I love KnockoutJS. I&rsquo;ve been using it for awhile now and I really enjoy it. That said, there are a few oddities with it, one such being the <code>checked</code> binding.</p>




<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have this scenario (as I do now):</p>




<p>You want to <code>foreach</code> a list of items, each one having a checkbox. You want to store the checked items in a list, for use throughout the view model (bulk updates, select all, deselect all, etc.). How do you go about doing this?</p>




<p>The &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; approach would be to add an observable property, <code>isSelected</code>, to each of your items. Then, in your markup, you can bind to that property:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;foreach: tasks&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;checkbox&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;checked: isSelected&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>That is OK. It&rsquo;s OK because what if you need to use that item (assuming you&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or other reusable object) somewhere else where you don&rsquo;t need that property. You could just attach it where you need it. It also makes it a bit tricky to manage the list of selected items (you&rsquo;d probably end up creating a <code>computed</code> array), as well as making it difficult to dynamically bind a checkbox list to a computed array.</p>




<p>What you may decide to do (like me) is to try and bind the <code>checked</code> to your own observable array, and assign the <code>value</code> of the checkbox to a model property like this:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;checkbox&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;checked: $root.selectedTaskIds, value: id&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>However, if you do this, you&rsquo;ll soon discover a few oddities:</p>




<ol>
<li>When you check the checkbox, the <em>string</em> value of your model property will be placed into the array.</li>
<li>Your model property <em>will change to this new string value</em> essentially changing your original model.</li>
</ol>




<p>There are reasons for these two crazy happenings, which I discovered:</p>




<ol>
<li>The <code>checked</code> binding bases its value on the <em>element&rsquo;s</em> value, which is stored as a string.</li>
<li>The <code>value</code> binding keeps the property you are bound to and the <em>element&rsquo;s value</em> in-sync, which is why your model&rsquo;s ID becomes a string.</li>
</ol>




<p>It turns out, we&rsquo;re suffering from some mental model breakdown. If you look at the KO documentation for <code>checked</code>, it&rsquo;s easy to believe the above syntax should work, after all, it says:</p>




<blockquote><p>Special consideration is given if your parameter resolves to an array. In this case, KO will set the element to be checked if the <strong>value</strong> matches an item in the array, and unchecked if it is not contained in the array.</p></blockquote>




<p>If the <em>value</em> matches&hellip; &ldquo;Cool!&rdquo; so I can just bind the <code>value:</code> to my model property? NOPE. You&rsquo;ll run into the aforementioned issues if you try.</p>




<h3>Making a smarter <code>checked</code> binding</h3>




<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t want to add <code>isSelected</code> properties everywhere, I decided to &ldquo;monkey patch&rdquo; the <code>checked</code> and <code>value</code> bindings to play nice together.</p>




<p>Essentially, all my patch does is two things:</p>




<ol>
<li>In the <code>checked</code> binding, if it finds a <code>value</code> binding, it binds to that value rather than the element&rsquo;s value.</li>
<li>In the <code>value</code> binding, it completely ignores any changes if the <code>checked</code> binding is present, essentially nullifying the binding.</li>
</ol>




<p>Here are the new binding definitions:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/4418574.js"></script>




<p>And you can see it in action here:</p>




<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/G8YZU/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>As you can see, now it works as you&rsquo;d expect! You can bind the <code>id</code> property to the list. You can also bind <code>$data</code> and you&rsquo;ll have the full object in your selected list.</p>

I&rsquo;m even more excited to also work on a Windows Phone app. That&rsquo;s why I bought a Surface RT and a new HTC 8X. I&rsquo;m all in.</p>




<p>So imagine my disappointment when, after five days, I receive this email:</p>




<blockquote><p>Windows Store: we couldn&rsquo;t certify your app</p></blockquote>




<p>Boo. <em>Okay,</em> I thought, <em>I must have missed something, no big deal.</em> Clearly the testers must have found something that I missed, since I ran my app through memory profiling and performance testing both on my PC and Surface. I even poured over the certification checklist and common points of failure. What did I miss?</p>




<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>




<p>Here&rsquo;s what the tester&rsquo;s note said on the report:</p>




<blockquote><p>F:: It is unclear how to create an account for this app to be reviewed. This prevented us from completing our review of this app.</p></blockquote>




<p><em>What?</em> &ldquo;Unclear&rdquo;? You mean, the first sentence of my &ldquo;Instructions to Testers&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t clear enough?</p>




<blockquote><p>Please use my account (***) to test the app with.</p></blockquote>




<p><em>So. Frustrating.</em> I could understand if I had perhaps put that information at the bottom of my note, forgot to include it, or something else&hellip; but I <em>put it at the top of the instructions</em> to avoid this very problem. How can I feel confident in this testing process if the testers don&rsquo;t read our instructions? It just seems to contribute to my overall view that the Windows Store is lacking in several areas and &ldquo;just isn&rsquo;t there&rdquo; yet but I suppose that rant is for another day.</p>




<p>What makes it worse is that the tutorial video I include in the app (that is accessible on the first screen) <strong>uses my account to demo.</strong> It just boggles my mind.</p>




<p><img src="http://ragemaker.net/images/Stupidity/seriouslyChan.png" alt="Seriously?" /></p>




<p>The icing on the cake was that it took 5 days for this to fail. I&rsquo;m sure it goes into a queue and that the actual time to perform &ldquo;content compliance&rdquo; is an hour or so but even knowing that, it just made it worse since now I have to wait an additional X days for something I shouldn&rsquo;t have had to wait for in the first place.</p>




<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else I can really do about it, though. I re-submitted it, I added extra emphasis in the Notes field, but what else is there? Just pray it works this time, I guess. Disappointing first-time experience, to say the least.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/59/using-knockout-bindings-in-your-winjs-application">Using Knockout Bindings in Your WinJS Application</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve done any serious Windows 8 development with WinJS, you&rsquo;ve probably come across this wall:</p>




<blockquote><p>I need to do some custom logic and data binding on this element and I wish I could just use <code>win-data-bind</code> to do it.</p></blockquote>




<p>In my case, all I wanted to do was toggle a CSS class based on my view model&rsquo;s property. In WinJS bindings, there is no way to call a custom binding converter with parameters nor can you access the DOM element from a converter, as far as I can tell.</p>




<p>Technically, you could call a function using <code>markSupportedForProcessing</code> and pass in these parameters, like this:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>But I am not sure that&rsquo;s a great idea (as the base.js source code has a lot of extra stuff around this method, which is why they expose an easier <code>WinJS.Binding.coverter</code>).</p>




<h2>Mix N&#8217; Match</h2>




<p>It turns out, it <em>seems</em> to be relatively straight-forward to make KO and WinJS work together. Why would you want to? Well, WinJS has a lot of useful features like WinJS.Promises, utilities, controls, templates, and lots of other stuff. You lose all that if you use a 3rd party library (like KO or jQuery) exclusively.</p>




<p>With this approach, you can choose what works best. You could go all out and use KO to bind all your stuff and then use WinJS for whatever else you need. I chose to just leverage the custom binding functionality.</p>




<h2>Let&rsquo;s do it!</h2>




<p>Once you have Knockout installed (via Nuget or what have you), be sure it&rsquo;s included in your page:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>default.html
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;!&mdash; WinJS references &mdash;&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/css/ui-dark.css&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/base.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/ui.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/scripts/knockout-2.2.0.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>I put it in default.html so it&rsquo;s globally accessible.</p>




<p>Now, all we are going to do is <strong>replace</strong> the call to <code>WinJS.Binding.processAll</code> with a function that intercepts the call and calls <code>ko.applyBindings</code>, then continues to call the built in WinJS function.</p>




<p>Create a new file, I named mine <em>*ko-winjs.js</em>:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/4183235.js?file=ko-winjs.js"></script>




<p>Then, just include this before <strong>default.js</strong> in your HTML file:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>default.html
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;!&mdash; WinJS references &mdash;&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/css/ui-dark.css&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/base.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/ui.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/scripts/knockout-2.2.0.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/scripts/ko-winjs.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re all set! Now you can do this in your templates:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/4183235.js?file=template.html"></script>




<p>Pretty awesome!</p>




<h2>Disclaimer</h2>




<p>I have no idea how inefficient this is, but my guess is that this adds extra processing time (plus, binding cache issues?). I have a small application so I&rsquo;m not too worried about it and it&rsquo;s the best thing I could come up with on short notice.</p>




<p>That said, if someone smarter than me and more familiar with KO and WinJS in general could take a peek at this&hellip; I&rsquo;d be super grateful, since I think this is a killer feature. If WinJS could just support KO-style binding syntax, I&rsquo;d be totally cool with that too!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/58/using-calc-and-media-queries-to-create-a-combinati">Using Calc() and Media Queries to Create a Combination Variable + Fixed Sidebar</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>The title of this post might be confusing, so let me describe our scenario:</p>




<p>I am working on a responsive layout, specifically one right now that has two columns, a content area and a right sidebar. This right sidebar needs to be flexible <em>up to a certain point</em> and then it needs to become fixed. In addition, both columns could be variable height, and on top of that, the two columns are sometimes split into two separate rows to achieve proper HTML markup order.</p>




<p>The reason the sidebar needs to have a minimum width is mostly due to the ads we&rsquo;re working with, since they have a fixed size. It might actually be possible to hack at the styles and make them pseudo-responsive, but I still want to share my tip with you, even if I don&rsquo;t end up using it.</p>




<p>I thought this was an interesting challenge because of two issues: the need for both flex <em>and</em> fixed for the same column.</p>




<h3>The Demo</h3>




<p>Here is the Fiddle I came up with where you can view the result:</p>




<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/mHvtM/4/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>




<h3>The Markup</h3>




<p>The markup is straightforward and simple. I essentially need two rows of two columns, where the right columns line up and <em>appear</em> to be a single sidebar. When I get down to the smaller breakpoints, both columns stop floating and stack vertically (but that is neither here nor there).</p>




<h3>The Styles</h3>




<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting. I start out the design with a 60% left column and 40% right column. However, I need the right column to stop being variable at 300px, and I need the left column to take up the remaining space.</p>




<p>The way I achieved this was by using a media query and the CSS3 <code>calc()</code> unit. I wanted to avoid Javascript at all costs.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Turns out, pretty simple!</p>




<h3>Gotchas</h3>




<p>Of course this world isn&rsquo;t perfect and neither is CSS3 support. According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=calc">Can I Use</a>, <code>calc</code> isn&rsquo;t supported in: IE &lt; 9, iOS &lt; 6.0, Android, Opera, or BB &lt; 10.0. That&rsquo;s lot of non-support.</p>




<p>So what to do? Well, in our case, it&rsquo;s not essential we maintain the fixed minimum-width. Especially if we can workaround the ads. If you <strong>must</strong> have the support, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. You could test for <code>calc</code> support using <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/feature-detects/css-calc.js">Modernizr</a>, then decide what to do in browsers that don&rsquo;t have that support (for example, throwing in the towel and just convert the layout to single column). You could also use a Javascript-based solution (which you might as well, if you&rsquo;re relying on Modernizr).</p>




<h3>Have a better solution?</h3>




<p>I&rsquo;d like to know. I&rsquo;m not a front-end expert, so there may be a more clever way to achieve this and maximize browser support. If you know of any way to do this better, please let me know down below.</p>

  <p>
    <p>There are at least a couple app contests I know of for Windows 8: <a href="http://apptivate.ms">Apptivate</a> and <a href="http://www.generationapp.com/giveaway/">GenerationApp</a>.</p>




<p>The prizes are cool and all you need to do is make an app. In fact, for Apptivate at least, <em>your app doesn&rsquo;t even need to be complete to win</em>!</p>




<p>Can&rsquo;t think of an app to make? No worries, just ask yourself: what site do you like and would you like to bring it to Windows 8 or WinRT? Then ask, does it have an API or feed or enough of <em>something</em> to make a usable app? If the answer is <strong>Yes</strong> to both of those questions, you have your app.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/56/what-would-a-windows-8-halo-app-look-like">What Would a Windows 8 Halo App Look Like?</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><strong>Update (10/24)</strong>: There&rsquo;s a good indication there&rsquo;ll be an API. If you log into <a href="http://dewxp.com">DewXP</a> with your Xbox Live account, it will display your spartan player model using a URL I haven&rsquo;t seen before:</p>




<blockquote><p><a href="https://stats.svc.halowaypoint.com/players/subkamran/h4/spartans/fullbody">https://stats.svc.halowaypoint.com/players/subkamran/h4/spartans/fullbody</a></p></blockquote>




<p>Nothing is at the root of that URL, but I assume the <strong>h4</strong> is for Halo 4-related stats. It also looked like it used OAuth to allow the DewXP &ldquo;app&rdquo; access to my profile. This is a good sign!</p>




<hr />




<p>I&rsquo;m a Halo fan. I enjoy playing with my friends, it&rsquo;s fun to be competitive and it&rsquo;s fun to compete against each other. One of the things me and my friends love is the ability to view our stats and history. It&rsquo;s all about bragging rights. Bungie used to have a <em>fan-fucking-tastic</em> site to view stats. Since the handover to 343, seeing stats has just not been the same nor as in-depth, though the core features have remained.</p>




<p>There are mixed reactions to this in the community, I would say leaning more on the negative side, even among my friends. However, after seeing all the footage of Halo 4, I have high hopes for the game as long as it continues to be competitive and to provide a source of stats and feedback.</p>




<p>So what does Halo have to do with Windows 8? Well, before Bungie handed the franchise off, they worked on releasing Halo Waypoint to several devices including <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/halo-waypoint/id468457600?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halo.companion&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, and <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/71466/halo-waypoint-premium-mobile-app-add-on-features-real-time">Windows Phone</a>. These apps are great for people like us who like to see our stats on the go or when we&rsquo;re not at the computer (like in front of the Xbox). I wanted to build a similar app for Windows 8 that just showed stats of my friends or other players. Simple, right? Wrong.</p>




<p>Bungie had originally released a <a href="http://www.bungie.net/fanclub/statsapi/Group/Resources/Article.aspx?cid=545064">poorly documented</a> (it&rsquo;s true) public API for their Halo stats but <em>at least</em> it was an API. Fan sites were able to run with this, creating sites like <a href="http://halotracker.com">HaloTracker</a>. The problem is, since 343i came into the picture, there has been no effort that we can see to provide an API (the old Bungie one is deprecated). This leaves site developers to resort to less-than-savory tactics to get at the stats, including screen scraping.</p>




<p>The only glimmering light on the horizon is that there are <a href="https://forums.halo.xbox.com/yaf_postst97564_Probably-confirmation-of-a-Halo-4-API.aspx">rumblings</a> of a Halo 4 API, which would be a god-send for the community. But it&rsquo;s just that, a hope and no confirmation.</p>




<h2>There must be an API somewhere, though</h2>




<p>There is. If you can get at the traffic on your mobile device that has Halo Waypoint, and you can get as far as seeing where that traffic goes, you&rsquo;ll discover there <em>is indeed a JSON web service</em>. Unfortunately, it requires authentication to the xbox.com domain, because the authentication cookie is sent on every request. In other words, it&rsquo;s not public and 343 probably doesn&rsquo;t want us using it.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if WinRT&rsquo;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh750287.aspx">Web Authentication Broker</a> could help in this case, but as far as I can tell, Xbox Live does not have an authentication endpoint. There must be <em>something</em>, as the Windows 8 Games app can connect to Xbox Live but I&rsquo;m assuming this isn&rsquo;t available to just anyone and that there&rsquo;s black magic involved. Even if you could somehow manage to authenticate and pass those headers into the WinJS XHR calls, there&rsquo;s still the tiny problem that we probably aren&rsquo;t <em>supposed</em> to be able to use this Waypoint API.</p>




<h2>My plea to 343</h2>




<p>343: you need to have an API. If the rumors are true that Halo 4 will be getting an API, that&rsquo;s <em>excellent</em> news because I strongly feel that if you want to build a community around the game, you really should let us go wild with the data.</p>




<p>Even if that pipe dream does come to pass, there&rsquo;s still the issue of previous Halo games. We know you have the stats. We know you have the API. Just figure out a way to make it public! Release the Waypoint API so we can start somewhere; secure it with API keys or OAuth or whatever else you need to do.</p>




<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t? People can&rsquo;t have an app like this unless <em>you</em> release it, and let&rsquo;s be honest: wouldn&rsquo;t you rather spend resources creating a great API to view stats and then let us do the dirty work and build around it?</p>

<p>This is a real app, living on my hard drive right now. It can fetch any player&rsquo;s data, integrates with Search, and is pretty sexy to see in motion. Unfortunately, none of you reading this post will ever get to see it, simply because it violates the Terms of Service. It screen-scrapes the Halo Waypoint site to get this data, which is not an acceptable way of getting data.</p>




<p>343, if you <em>are</em> planning to release a Windows 8 application, good on you! But my point still stands: this took me a couple days to put together and you didn&rsquo;t spend a dime on it, or assign Joe Bob 50% to innovation, or call your agency and have them put together mockups and charge you thousands of dollars. I did this in two evenings with a little bit of free time. There are so many things that are possible with a platform like Windows 8:</p>




<ul>
<li>Leaderboards among your friends</li>
<li>Live tile updates of your games</li>
<li>Beautiful high-res imagery of medals, ranks, and your spartan models</li>
<li>Awesome win/lose charts and game history</li>
<li>Map breakdowns</li>
<li>Weapon overviews and tips</li>
<li>Clan or group management</li>
<li>Delivering video and other rich content to your users</li>
</ul>




<p>And that&rsquo;s what I could think of on-the-spot, I&rsquo;m sure after seeing these screenshots people could think of a lot more.</p>




<p>Release an API, 343. Your community will thank you for it.</p>
