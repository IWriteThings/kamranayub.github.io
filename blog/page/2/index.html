  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/78/tccc15-see-you-again-in-april">TCCC15: See You Again in April!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Well, that was a blast. Yesterday was <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">TCCC15</a> and it was great. Many awesome sessions, including several by my fellow co-workers <a href="http://twitter.com/ErikOnarhem">Erik Onarheim</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenErstad">Stephen Erstad</a>.</p>




<p>Thanks to all who attended <a href="/Blog/Posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">my talk</a>! I got +10 votes on the code camp speaker site and 9 llamas, which made me feel pretty good!</p>




<p>Please send me feedback at my email or leave a comment here with your thoughts. The code will be available (soon) at <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling</a>. It&rsquo;ll be released under an open license but is meant to be educational. The app will also be available soon in the Windows Phone store.</p>




<p>If you missed my talk, you can still get all the bits once I release the app on GitHub. Sure, there won&rsquo;t be droning voice over the code, but you can still see all the steps I took to enhance it.</p>




<p>There was only one big hiccup where Nuget would not install a package, even when I had it in my local repository (it installed the other ones). I remembered some time ago Scott Hanselman mentioning that Nuget packages were just zip files. I quickly changed my Nuget package extension (because I didn&rsquo;t have Nuget Package Explorer installed), got the DLL, and added it as a project reference to quickly save my skin. Thanks Scott!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">TCCC15: Leveling Up Your Windows Phone App</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s talk time again! I&rsquo;m lucky to be giving yet another talk at Twin Cities Code Camp (my second one!). Last time was a lot of fun! This time, we&rsquo;re <a href="/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">leaving the Web API pasture</a> and exploring the fun world of Windows Phone development.</p>




<p>TCCC15 is October 19 and I&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Schedule.aspx">speaking in Rapson 45 at 2:15pm</a>, so come say hi!</p>




<h2>Why You Should Attend</h2>




<p>If you&rsquo;re an experienced or even a beginning Windows Phone developer, come. If you&rsquo;re still not sure why Windows Phone is cool, come.</p>




<p>The code I&rsquo;ll be showing will start out at a beginner level and move all the way passed intermediate to advanced. By the end, for example, you&rsquo;ll see how to implement a custom message box that fully supports Caliburn binding, dismissal, and the view lifecycle.</p>




<p>Finally, all the code will be available on GitHub soon after (this weekend?). I just need time to remove any secrets and figure out a license that will let me publish the app and own it while still allowing you all to learn from it.</p>




<h2>What We&rsquo;ll Talk About</h2>




<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing a &ldquo;live coding&rdquo; presentation. In reality, I&rsquo;ll be coding and switching to Git branches that showcase the fully completed code then walk through it. The app I&rsquo;ll be presenting is actually a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; app; meaning that it works fine and does everything I need it to. However, anyone whose done app development can tell you that the work isn&rsquo;t done when your app runs and all your tests pass; there&rsquo;s still plenty of work making it &ldquo;production ready.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll cover in my session!</p>




<p>Right now, my talk is divided into 5 sections covering MVVM, fast resume, logging, about page, and UX improvement. The sections are designed in a way that will expose you to many different parts of my preferred MVVM framework, Caliburn. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll also learn some great tips &amp; tricks I&rsquo;ve found along my journey designing Windows Phone apps.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m excited because we&rsquo;ll start with the basic premise of an app (which works) and then take it to a production-ready application. Literally, <strong>by the end of the presentation</strong>, I could publish my app to the store and feel good about it.</p>




<p>I hope to see you on Saturday!</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> My session slides are available online at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kamranayub/bending-apis-to-your-will-using-windows-phone">SpeakerDeck</a>. If you attended, I hope you enjoyed it!</p>




<p>Will you be attending <a href="http://mdc.ilmservice.com">Minnesota Developer Conference</a>? Come see me at 12:45pm if you want to get jump started with creating connected Windows Phone apps. I&rsquo;ll be talking about how to connect to APIs and useful patterns I&rsquo;ve learned throughout my (limited) development experience. Even if you <em>have</em> developed an app, I hope to share some tips that might help improve your app and it&rsquo;ll definitely provide a jumping off point if you haven&rsquo;t started yet.</p>




<p>My current rehearsals clock in at around a 45 minute presentation which leaves a healthy 30 minutes for questions and seeing any live code, which will be at the audiences&#8217; whim. I&rsquo;ll be walking through a real application I&rsquo;m in the middle of developing so I hope to share some patterns and practices that I&rsquo;ve found useful when developing connected apps like MVVM, Async/Await, offline storage, and more.</p>




<p>See you on Thursday!</p>

    <p>This comes directly from a tip <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/engjbw">Mike Zarandona posted on Coderwall</a>, which I&rsquo;m posting here to keep track of it:</p>




<hr />




<p>I was sick of borrowing a friend&rsquo;s retina laptop to test retina images. After a little poking around, I discovered a few options baked right into the most popular browsers.</p>




<p>In Google Chrome:</p>




<ul>
<li>Browse to chrome://flags</li>
<li>Search for and enable Force high DPI mode</li>
</ul>




<p>In FireFox:</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs">Debounced After Render Pattern for Knockout.js</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When dealing with Knockout-based lists, I think the built-in events/callbacks provided by Knockout leave a bit to be desired. For example, a common case I here people complain about is that the <code>afterRender</code> callback for the <code>foreach/template</code> bindings executes for each item in the array, not after all the elements have been rendered.</p>




<p>There are probably better ways to <em>resolve</em> this using Promises (pun intended), but here&rsquo;s one way to attack it using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-65">Underscore.js</a>&rsquo;s <code>debounce</code> method that&rsquo;s easy to understand and use.</p>




<p>The <code>debounce</code> method:</p>




<blockquote><p>Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for N milliseconds. If immediate is passed, trigger the function on the leading edge, instead of the trailing.</p></blockquote>




<p>This is useful for high-octane events like rendering elements, window resizing, or capture mouse events.</p>




<p>Here&rsquo;s a Fiddle that demonstrates a way to execute a callback after all the elements in a list have been rendered (and filters them to only <code>li</code> DOM elements):</p>




<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/yEhEt/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>This can be cleaned up multiple ways, I think a cleaner way to implement this would be through resolving a promise and then overriding the <code>foreach</code> and <code>template</code> binding to support it, for example, <code>afterAllRender</code> or something.</p>




<p>But this gets the job done and is easy to implement!</p>

  <p>
    <p>I gave a talk this past weekend at Twin Cities Code Camp; it was my first public talk (hopefully the first of many?). It was a deep dive on selected ASP.NET Web API topics (as voted on by the audience) and you can view it on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kamranayub/diving-into-the-deep-wih-asp-dot-net">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>




<p>You can also <a href="http://sdrv.ms/ZgUuGI">download the notes</a> (i.e. links, comments, resources) from my SkyDrive.</p>




<p>If you were there and saw me present, <a href="http://spkr8.com/t/21961">please rate how I did</a>! It&rsquo;s the only way I really have of getting feedback.</p>




<h3>Thoughts</h3>




<p>I thought it went decent for my first talk. I was pretty nervous; I even forgot to say my name&hellip; but whatever! Hopefully by volunteering to do more talks I&rsquo;ll get the hang of it. All those business leadership classes paid off, my friends said that I didn&rsquo;t appear nervous, I projected my voice, and some folks were kind enough to say they liked it which is all I wanted. I also got the largest room right after lunch and it was probably 200 degrees. The Wi-Fi was deathly slow (&lt; 1Mbps) so that didn&rsquo;t help. Next time I&rsquo;ll plan to either take more screenshots or limit the online interaction.</p>




<p>I also think I had too many topics; I knew we couldn&rsquo;t get through all of them but one of my co-workers suggested to scale it down in order to hit specific topics and spend more time on each. It&rsquo;s so hard because they&rsquo;re all great topics to talk about&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even list content negotiation or automatic documentation.</p>




<p>Overall I was pleased with the outcome; I said what I wanted to say and it was a lot of fun.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Word documents on my computer that I&rsquo;ve had since I was a teen. I&rsquo;ve been keeping them all through my PC upgrades for no particular reason except for times like these when I need to laugh at myself.</p>




<p>I just found this nugget in some random debate outline, I was 13 when I wrote it (I had just started working in web design):</p>




<blockquote><p>Team work, in my opinion, not only involves working with your teammates, but working with your audience to find out what they want. What company does not ask their audience what they want? I don&rsquo;t think many do.</p></blockquote>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/71/anecdote-i-frustrate-easily">Anecdote: I Frustrate Easily</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When I first started my &ldquo;real job&rdquo; where I&rsquo;m at I was put on an internal site. It was a beast, it had a lot of history, and more importantly, it was <strong>damn ugly and sometimes hard to use</strong>. The site was used by developers and no one on the team had much UI experience. I was frustrated. I couldn&rsquo;t work on this thing and have it be ugly, why should we have a tool that gets used every day that&rsquo;s a bear to use? &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s always been that way&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me. For about a month I worked outside of work, off the sprint, and I re-tooled the CSS, markup, and UX while still maintaining the overall functionality and behavior. No one asked, I just did it <strong>because I was frustrated.</strong> Sure, at some points, people were sort of wondering what the heck I was doing but in the end, everyone loved the changes and everyone keeps mentioning how great the changes have been since. I believe it was also the start of a bigger push to make things easy to use internally but I suppose correlation does not equal causation :)</p>




<p>I think that&rsquo;s what <a href="http://zachholman.com/">Zach Holman</a> means when he says to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/holman/keeping-people?slide=31">hire people who frustrate easily</a> and that&rsquo;s what triggered this anecdote.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/70/protip-using-anti-forgery-token-with-aspnet-web-ap">Protip: Using Anti-Forgery Token With ASP.NET Web API on MVC 4 on AppHarbor</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I just ran into and solved this problem so I thought I&rsquo;d share (I&rsquo;ll also be talking about this at my upcoming talk).</p>




<h3>Anti-Forgery in MVC</h3>




<p>In vanilla MVC, you&rsquo;d do anti-forgery like this in your Razor view:</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Then in a controller (POST):</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="na">[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Cool. But what about Web API? It uses a totally different pipeline and likely you&rsquo;re interacting with it via JQuery or other AJAX framework.</p>




<h3>ValidateHttpAntiForgeryToken</h3>




<p>Here are some references I used when trying to implement Anti-Forgery with Web API:</p>




<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11725988/problems-implementing-validatingantiforgerytoken-attribute-for-web-api-with-mvc">Problems implementing ValidatingAntiForgeryToken attribute for Web API with MVC 4 RC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11476883/web-api-and-validateantiforgerytoken">Web API and ValidateAntiForgeryToken</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-(csrf">Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks</a>-attacks)</li>
<li>MVC 4 SPA template</li>
</ul>




<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub: the two SO posts above implement this quite differently than the MVC 4 SPA template and the last article referenced. Both approaches actually worked locally for me, but both failed once I deployed to AppHarbor.</p>




<p>The long and short of it is that I was using the HTTP header <code>__RequestVerificationToken</code>. This is a no-no and I&rsquo;m sort of the dumb one here in that I should <em>know</em> not to use custom headers like that.</p>




<p>My friends, the <em>proper</em> way is to use the <code>X-*</code> convention, so the HTTP header in your AJAX requests become <code>X-XSRF-Token</code> instead.</p>




<p>Apparently, AppHarbor was stripping off the other header on AJAX POST. I was receiving an error about the given header could not be found.</p>




<p>The working solution is below:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/5449779.js"></script>




<p>The <code>machineKey</code> thing is also key to remember on a cloud host/web farm environment.</p>




<p>I hope that helps somebody out there.</p>




<h3>Aside</h3>




<p>In the last article referenced, the <code>AntiForgery.GetTokens()</code> didn&rsquo;t work for me on AH. I kept getting the error:</p>




<pre><code>System.Web.Mvc.HttpAntiForgeryException (0x80004005): The required anti-forgery cookie "__RequestVerificationToken" is not present.
</code></pre>




<p>I didn&rsquo;t get far enough to see what actual cookies were present because I switched to the other method outlined in the two SO posts. I just thought you should know that it just didn&rsquo;t work. I believe it&rsquo;s because <code>GetTokens</code> does not create a new cookie if the <code>cookieToken</code> has a value where as using <code>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()</code> does. The <a href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/9a83b63f3f889e3f2c979274fe3e8f7610e06b98#src/System.Web.WebPages/Helpers/AntiXsrf/AntiForgeryWorker.cs">source code</a> makes that clear in the comments. Why it worked locally I have no idea and at this point, don&rsquo;t care!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/69/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-wor">Put the Cloud to Work, Pt 1: Create a Background Worker Using Quartz.NET</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve written a [long] article for Tech.pro on <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1222/put-the-cloud-to-work-pt-1-create-a-background-worker-using-quartznet">how to use Quartz.NET to build an end-to-end background worker on AppHarbor</a>.</p>




<p>I plan to write a couple more follow-ups about more advanced usage of Quartz with a pretty big finale (I don&rsquo;t want to get anyone&rsquo;s hopes up though).</p>




<p>Some fun stats:</p>




<ul>
<li>~5300 words</li>
<li>~40 hours of work</li>
<li>~40 pages in PDF</li>
</ul>




<p>It seems longer than it is; most of it is code snippets and pictures but it takes about 20 minutes to read and about 45-60 minutes to work through (follow along).</p>




<p>I marked it as a Beginner tutorial and as such went into a lot of detail I wouldn&rsquo;t normally spend time on if it was just a blog post. I find writing formal articles forces me to verify what I know (or I think I know), explore alternatives, and do a deep-dive into whatever topic I want to talk about. It&rsquo;s mostly driven by fear: fear of being wrong, fear of being humiliated, fear of what other people think. Writing about a topic forces you to learn about things you maybe thought you knew but didn&rsquo;t really. I also believe it helps you become better at teaching others; if you can&rsquo;t explain what you know, do you really know it? At it&rsquo;s core, it&rsquo;s just good exercise!</p>




<p>I chose tech.pro because I like what they&rsquo;re trying to do, I like that they&rsquo;re open with development, and I also like the cash prize if your article is the top in its category ($1000). I also like that they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; your content; you&rsquo;re free to post it to other venues and it&rsquo;s your own work. I think it already has some great tutorials, including ones by someone I follow regularly, <a href="http://tech.pro/filipw/blog">Filip W</a>.</p>
