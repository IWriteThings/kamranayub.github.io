    <p>I just published an article on Tech.pro that <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1749/get-your-ci-on-with-travis-ci">walks through getting started with Travis CI</a>. We use it for Excalibur.js and that was my first
time configuring it, so I thought I might as well write up a nice tutorial for other people. It&rsquo;s really an awesome service, especially
for open source projects.</p>

<p>I just released my second Windows Phone app, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/bowling-calculator/9287a99a-6068-4ff4-925b-988c8c99dbf6">Bowling Calculator</a>. It&rsquo;s an <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">open source app</a> that I created when <a href="/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">I gave my talk at TCCC15</a>.
If you&rsquo;re a fellow developer, feel free to send me a pull request with any bug fixes or enhancements. I want to keep it focused on
the simple use case of scoring a bowling game; I don&rsquo;t need it to track multiple games or keep track of history. It&rsquo;s purpose is to serve
as a production-ready sample app and to also be good at what it aims to do.</p>

the testing. That kind of acceptance for pull requests is great to see because it makes me feel good
about contributing and is a bit less intimidating.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve just pushed a new version of Kamranicus that is built using the static site generator, <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. Octopress uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate static sites.</p>




<p>I decided to switch because I can leverage GitHub Pages which are <strong>free</strong> and I can use a custom domain. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit because I can just piggyback on GitHub&rsquo;s cloud hosting for free and not worry about incurring any downtime due to database issues (something that happened more than a few times with the last ASP.NET MVC and SQL-based site).</p>




<p>I really enjoyed setting up Octopress, it was easy to migrate my posts. I highly recommend it! It would be even better to have a .NET/C#-based static site generator that supported all of Jekyll&rsquo;s configuration options, except with Razor-based layouts and templating. Mmmm, that sounds pretty good. Someone get on that.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/79/just-pushed-blackjack-sample-game">Just Pushed: Blackjack Sample Game</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s finally done! I sat down today and dug through my backups to find my original WPF BlackJack game I wrote way back when WPF was really cool. I converted it to VS 2013, made sure it still ran, organized the solution, and hit deploy. It&rsquo;s now up on GitHub for your learning pleasure. There are no Nuget packages here! This was before Nuget where I had to find code to learn from and, ahem, copy. The deck is also something I found online. If I find the source, I&rsquo;ll be sure to attribute it properly.</p>




<p><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/">https://github.com/kamranayub/blackjack/</a></p>




<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/5122176" width="500" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>




<p>This was a sample game I wrote to learn OO design and WPF. There&rsquo;s some cool animations, sound effects, and a pretty fun Blackjack implementation. It&rsquo;s very &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and should be easy to digest. I never got around to implementing all the cool AI but now that it&rsquo;s on GitHub for all to see, maybe someone will pick it up.</p>




<p>I also think it&rsquo;d be fun to port it to Windows 8 C# and XAML. It could be an app I release on the store, free and open source.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/78/tccc15-see-you-again-in-april">TCCC15: See You Again in April!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Well, that was a blast. Yesterday was <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">TCCC15</a> and it was great. Many awesome sessions, including several by my fellow co-workers <a href="http://twitter.com/ErikOnarhem">Erik Onarheim</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenErstad">Stephen Erstad</a>.</p>




<p>Thanks to all who attended <a href="/Blog/Posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">my talk</a>! I got +10 votes on the code camp speaker site and 9 llamas, which made me feel pretty good!</p>




<p>Please send me feedback at my email or leave a comment here with your thoughts. The code will be available (soon) at <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling">http://github.com/kamranayub/wp-bowling</a>. It&rsquo;ll be released under an open license but is meant to be educational. The app will also be available soon in the Windows Phone store.</p>




<p>If you missed my talk, you can still get all the bits once I release the app on GitHub. Sure, there won&rsquo;t be droning voice over the code, but you can still see all the steps I took to enhance it.</p>




<p>There was only one big hiccup where Nuget would not install a package, even when I had it in my local repository (it installed the other ones). I remembered some time ago Scott Hanselman mentioning that Nuget packages were just zip files. I quickly changed my Nuget package extension (because I didn&rsquo;t have Nuget Package Explorer installed), got the DLL, and added it as a project reference to quickly save my skin. Thanks Scott!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/77/tccc15-leveling-up-your-windows-phone-app">TCCC15: Leveling Up Your Windows Phone App</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s talk time again! I&rsquo;m lucky to be giving yet another talk at Twin Cities Code Camp (my second one!). Last time was a lot of fun! This time, we&rsquo;re <a href="/Blog/Posts/66/about-my-web-api-session-at-twin-cities-code-camp">leaving the Web API pasture</a> and exploring the fun world of Windows Phone development.</p>




<p>TCCC15 is October 19 and I&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Schedule.aspx">speaking in Rapson 45 at 2:15pm</a>, so come say hi!</p>




<h2>Why You Should Attend</h2>




<p>If you&rsquo;re an experienced or even a beginning Windows Phone developer, come. If you&rsquo;re still not sure why Windows Phone is cool, come.</p>




<p>The code I&rsquo;ll be showing will start out at a beginner level and move all the way passed intermediate to advanced. By the end, for example, you&rsquo;ll see how to implement a custom message box that fully supports Caliburn binding, dismissal, and the view lifecycle.</p>




<p>Finally, all the code will be available on GitHub soon after (this weekend?). I just need time to remove any secrets and figure out a license that will let me publish the app and own it while still allowing you all to learn from it.</p>




<h2>What We&rsquo;ll Talk About</h2>




<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing a &ldquo;live coding&rdquo; presentation. In reality, I&rsquo;ll be coding and switching to Git branches that showcase the fully completed code then walk through it. The app I&rsquo;ll be presenting is actually a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; app; meaning that it works fine and does everything I need it to. However, anyone whose done app development can tell you that the work isn&rsquo;t done when your app runs and all your tests pass; there&rsquo;s still plenty of work making it &ldquo;production ready.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll cover in my session!</p>




<p>Right now, my talk is divided into 5 sections covering MVVM, fast resume, logging, about page, and UX improvement. The sections are designed in a way that will expose you to many different parts of my preferred MVVM framework, Caliburn. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll also learn some great tips &amp; tricks I&rsquo;ve found along my journey designing Windows Phone apps.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;m excited because we&rsquo;ll start with the basic premise of an app (which works) and then take it to a production-ready application. Literally, <strong>by the end of the presentation</strong>, I could publish my app to the store and feel good about it.</p>




<p>I hope to see you on Saturday!</p>

<p>Will you be attending <a href="http://mdc.ilmservice.com">Minnesota Developer Conference</a>? Come see me at 12:45pm if you want to get jump started with creating connected Windows Phone apps. I&rsquo;ll be talking about how to connect to APIs and useful patterns I&rsquo;ve learned throughout my (limited) development experience. Even if you <em>have</em> developed an app, I hope to share some tips that might help improve your app and it&rsquo;ll definitely provide a jumping off point if you haven&rsquo;t started yet.</p>




<p>My current rehearsals clock in at around a 45 minute presentation which leaves a healthy 30 minutes for questions and seeing any live code, which will be at the audiences&#8217; whim. I&rsquo;ll be walking through a real application I&rsquo;m in the middle of developing so I hope to share some patterns and practices that I&rsquo;ve found useful when developing connected apps like MVVM, Async/Await, offline storage, and more.</p>




<p>See you on Thursday!</p>

  <p>
    <p>This comes directly from a tip <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/engjbw">Mike Zarandona posted on Coderwall</a>, which I&rsquo;m posting here to keep track of it:</p>




<hr />




<p>I was sick of borrowing a friend&rsquo;s retina laptop to test retina images. After a little poking around, I discovered a few options baked right into the most popular browsers.</p>




<p>In Google Chrome:</p>




<ul>
<li>Browse to chrome://flags</li>
<li>Search for and enable Force high DPI mode</li>
</ul>




<p>In FireFox:</p>




<ul>
<li>Browse to about:config</li>
<li>Search for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</li>
</ul>

  <h2><a href="/blog/posts/74/debounced-after-render-pattern-for-knockoutjs">Debounced After Render Pattern for Knockout.js</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When dealing with Knockout-based lists, I think the built-in events/callbacks provided by Knockout leave a bit to be desired. For example, a common case I here people complain about is that the <code>afterRender</code> callback for the <code>foreach/template</code> bindings executes for each item in the array, not after all the elements have been rendered.</p>




<p>There are probably better ways to <em>resolve</em> this using Promises (pun intended), but here&rsquo;s one way to attack it using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-65">Underscore.js</a>&rsquo;s <code>debounce</code> method that&rsquo;s easy to understand and use.</p>




<p>The <code>debounce</code> method:</p>




<blockquote><p>Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for N milliseconds. If immediate is passed, trigger the function on the leading edge, instead of the trailing.</p></blockquote>




<p>This is useful for high-octane events like rendering elements, window resizing, or capture mouse events.</p>




<p>Here&rsquo;s a Fiddle that demonstrates a way to execute a callback after all the elements in a list have been rendered (and filters them to only <code>li</code> DOM elements):</p>




<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/kamranayub/yEhEt/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>This can be cleaned up multiple ways, I think a cleaner way to implement this would be through resolving a promise and then overriding the <code>foreach</code> and <code>template</code> binding to support it, for example, <code>afterAllRender</code> or something.</p>




<p>But this gets the job done and is easy to implement!</p>
