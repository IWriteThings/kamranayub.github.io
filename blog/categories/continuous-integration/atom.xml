    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re on Windows Azure and using continuous deployment through Git, you may not know you are using an open source platform called
<a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu">Kudu</a> behind-the-scenes that performs your deployment. If this is the first time you&rsquo;ve heard of Kudu and you&rsquo;ve been
using Azure for awhile, it&rsquo;s time to <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu">get acquainted</a>. Kudu is amazing. It has a whole REST API that lets you manage
deployments, trigger builds, trigger webjobs, view processes, a command prompt, and a ton more.</p>

<p>You can get to your Kudu console by visiting</p>

<pre><code>https://&lt;yoursite&gt;.scm.azurewebsites.net
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>.scm.</strong> part is the key, as that is where the Kudu site is hosted.</p>

<h2>Customizing Kudu deployments</h2>

<p>One of the other things it offers is a <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Custom-Deployment-Script">customized deployment script</a>. I&rsquo;ve customized mine because I have a test
project where I run automated tests during the build. This is useful since it&rsquo;ll fail the build if I make any changes
that break my tests and forces me to keep things up-to-date resulting in a higher quality codebase.</p>

<p>If you want to generate your own script, it&rsquo;s pretty easy. Just follow the steps <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Custom-Deployment-Script">outlined here</a>. For example, after
customizing my script here&rsquo;s what my section looks like to run my tests:</p>

<p>```
:: 3. Build unit tests
call :ExecuteCmd &ldquo;%MSBUILD_PATH%&rdquo; &ldquo;%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\src\Tests\Tests.csproj&rdquo; /nologo /verbosity:m /t:Build /p:AutoParameterizationWebConfigConnectionStrings=false;Configuration=Release /p:SolutionDir=&ldquo;%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%.\&rdquo; %SCM_BUILD_ARGS%</p>

<p>IF !ERRORLEVEL! NEQ 0 goto error
```</p>

<p>All I really did was copy step 2 in the script that builds my web project and just change the path to my tests project.</p>

<p>Finally, I run the tests using the packaged Nunit test runner (checked into source control):</p>

<p><code>
call :ExecuteCmd "%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\tools\nunit\nunit-console.exe" "%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\src\Tests\bin\Release\Tests.dll" /framework:v4.5.1
IF !ERRORLEVEL! NEQ 0 goto error
</code></p>

<p>Simple!</p>

<h2>Now the fun part</h2>

<p>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice if you start running tests on your builds is that this starts to slow down your continuous deployment workflow.
For 90% of the time this is acceptable, after all, you can wait a few minutes to see your changes show up on the site. But sometimes,
especially for production hotfixes or trial-and-error config changes, that 3-5 minutes becomes unbearable.</p>

<p>In cases like this, I&rsquo;ve set up a little addition to my script that will read the git commit message and take action depending on what phrases it sees.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say I commit a change that is just a config change and I know I don&rsquo;t need to run any tests or I really want the quick build.
This is what my commit message looks like:</p>

<pre><code>[notest] just changing App.config
</code></pre>

<p>That phrase <code>[notest]</code> is something my script looks for at build time and if it&rsquo;s present it will skip running tests!
You can use this same logic to do pretty much anything you want. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like after step 3 in my script:</p>

<p>```
:: Above at top of file</p>

<p>IF NOT DEFINED RUN_TESTS (
   SET RUN_TESTS=1
)</p>

<p>:: 4. Run unit tests
echo Latest commit ID is &ldquo;%SCM_COMMIT_ID%&rdquo;</p>

<p>call git show -s &ldquo;%SCM_COMMIT_ID%&rdquo; &mdash;pretty=%%%%s > commitmessage.txt
SET /p COMMIT_MESSAGE=&lt;commitmessage.txt</p>

<p>echo Latest commit message is &ldquo;%COMMIT_MESSAGE%&rdquo;</p>

<p>IF NOT &ldquo;x%COMMIT_MESSAGE:[notest]=%&rdquo;==&ldquo;x%COMMIT_MESSAGE%&rdquo; (
   SET RUN_TESTS=0
)</p>

<p>IF /I &ldquo;%RUN_TESTS%&rdquo; NEQ &ldquo;0&rdquo; (</p>

<pre><code>echo Running unit tests
call :ExecuteCmd "%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\tools\nunit\nunit-console.exe" "%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\src\Tests\bin\Release\Tests.dll" /framework:v4.5.1
IF !ERRORLEVEL! NEQ 0 goto error
</code></pre>

<p>) ELSE (</p>

<pre><code>echo Not running unit tests because [notest] was present in commit message
</code></pre>

<p>)
```</p>

<p>Alright, there&rsquo;s definitely some batch file black magic incantations going on here! So let&rsquo;s break it down.</p>

<pre><code>echo Latest commit ID is "%SCM_COMMIT_ID%"
</code></pre>

<p>Kudu defines several useful <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deployment-Environment">environment variables</a> that you have access to, including the current commit ID.
I&rsquo;m just echoing it out so I can debug when viewing the log output.</p>

<pre><code>call git show -s "%SCM_COMMIT_ID%" --pretty=%%%%s &gt; commitmessage.txt
SET /p COMMIT_MESSAGE=&lt;commitmessage.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Alright. This took me some real trial and error. Git lets you <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-show"><code>show</code> any commit message</a> and can format it using a printf format string (<code>--pretty=%s</code>).
However, due to the weird escaping rules of batch files and variables, this requires not one but <strong>four</strong> <code>%</code> signs. Go figure.</p>

<p>Next I pipe it to a file, this is only so I can read the file back and store the message in a batch variable (<code>COMMIT_MESSAGE</code>), on the next line.
<strong>Kudu team:</strong> It would be sweet to add a <code>SCM_COMMIT_MESSAGE</code> environment variable!</p>

<pre><code>IF NOT "x%COMMIT_MESSAGE:[notest]=%"=="x%COMMIT_MESSAGE%" (
   SET RUN_TESTS=0
)
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s going on here? I&rsquo;ll <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7005951/batch-file-find-if-substring-is-in-string-not-in-a-file">let StackOverflow explain</a>. The <code>:[notest]=</code> portion REPLACES the term &ldquo;[notest]&rdquo; in
the preceding variable (<code>COMMIT_MESSAGE</code>) with an empty string. The <code>x</code> prefix character guards against batch file weirdness.
So if <code>[notest]</code> is NOT present, this will return true (the strings match). If it is present, the condition will be false and so we do <code>IF NOT</code>
since we want to execute when that is the case.</p>

<p>If <code>[notest]</code> is present in the message, we set another variable, <code>RUN_TESTS</code> to 0.</p>

<pre><code>IF /I "%RUN_TESTS%" NEQ "0" (
    echo Running unit tests
    call :ExecuteCmd "%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\tools\nunit\nunit-console.exe" "%DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE%\src\Tests\bin\Release\Tests.dll" /framework:v4.5.1
    IF !ERRORLEVEL! NEQ 0 goto error
) ELSE (
    echo Not running unit tests because [notest] was present in commit message
)
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>RUN_TESTS</code> does not evaluate to 0, then we run the tests! Otherwise we echo out an informative message as to why it was skipped.</p>

<p>Phew. So how much time do we save on <code>[notest]</code> builds now?</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/11734864/9a5e5e10-9f80-11e5-92ff-b93a1d9c994a.png" alt="No test build" /></p>

<p>Compared to a build with tests:</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/11734880/b874bed0-9f80-11e5-9af2-8e0425a02563.png" alt="Build with tests" /></p>

<p>So that flag cuts the build in half! Nice! There are probably some other ways to improve the time. By the way, if you&rsquo;re wondering what&rsquo;s taking so long
in your build, you can use the Kudu <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/REST-API">REST endpoint</a> to see your deployment logs (<strong>/api/deployments</strong> endoint) which contain full timestamp information!</p>

<p>Happy continuous deployment!</p>
