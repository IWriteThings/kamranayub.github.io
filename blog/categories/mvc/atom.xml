    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have an urge to write a quick list of tips for improving an ASP.NET MVC application because
I just got done reviewing some code for a support ticket at work. It&rsquo;s still fresh
in my mind and I wanted to get some of my thoughts down to share with others. If you
have been doing MVC for a while, I don&rsquo;t think much of this is news. It&rsquo;s more
for those of you that don&rsquo;t do MVC often or are new to MVC.</p>

<p>Imagine this: you&rsquo;ve been tasked to figure out why a web application is using 2GB of memory on the
production web servers. You pull down the version that&rsquo;s currently in production and run it locally
to profile and debug.</p>

<p>After looking through the code, doing some profiling, maybe shaking your head a bit, you&rsquo;ve figured
out what the issue is and now you need to give some feedback.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me today and out of that experience, 5 tips you can follow to keep
your ASP.NET MVC codebase working as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<h3>1. Understand the queries in your problem domain</h3>

<p>The root cause of the support ticket I received was a simple case of fetching too much
data from the database, causing obscene amounts of memory usage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a common enough issue. You&rsquo;re building a simple blog, it has posts and it has media (images, videos, attachments).
You put a Media array onto your Post domain object. Your Media domain object has all the image
data stored in a byte array. Since you&rsquo;re using an ORM, there&rsquo;s a certain way you need to design your domain model
to play nice; we&rsquo;ve all experienced this.</p>

<p>```c#
public class BlogPost {</p>

<pre><code>public ICollection&lt;BlogMedia&gt; Media { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>public class BlogMedia {</p>

<pre><code>public byte[] Data { get; set; }

public string Name { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing absolutely wrong with this design. You&rsquo;ve modeled your domain accurately. The problem is, when you
issue a query through your favorite ORM, it eagerly loads all the data associated with your blog post:</p>

<p>```c#
public IList<BlogPost> GetNewestPosts(int take) {</p>

<pre><code>return _db.BlogPosts.OrderByDescending(p =&gt; p.PostDate).Take(take).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>A seemingly innocuous line (unless you&rsquo;ve been bitten), a sneaky monster is lying in wait with big consequences if you haven&rsquo;t disabled
lazy loading or didn&rsquo;t tell your ORM to ignore that big <code>Data</code> property on blog media.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand how your ORM queries and maps objects and make sure you only query what you need (for example using projection).</p>

<p>```c#
public IList<PostSummary> GetNewestPosts(int take) {</p>

<pre><code>return _db.BlogPosts.OrderByDescending(p =&gt; p.PostDate).Take(take).Select(p =&gt; new PostSummary() {
    Title = p.Title,
    Id = p.Id
}).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This ensures we only grab the amount of data we really need for the task. If all you&rsquo;re doing is using the title and ID to build a link on the homepage, <em>just ask</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to have more than 5 methods on a repository; be as granular as you need to be for your UI.</p>

<h3>2. Don&rsquo;t call your repositories from your views</h3>

<p>This one&rsquo;s a little sneaky. Consider this line in an MVC view:</p>

<p>```c#
@foreach(var post in Model.RelatedPosts) {</p>

<pre><code>...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>It <em>seems</em> innocent enough. But if we take a look at what exactly that model property is hiding:</p>

<p>```c#
public class MyViewModel {</p>

<pre><code>public IList&lt;BlogPost&gt; RelatedPosts {
    get { return new BlogRepository().GetRelatedPosts(this.Tags); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Yikes! Your &ldquo;view model&rdquo; has business logic in it on top of calling a data access method directly. Now you&rsquo;ve introduced data
access code somewhere it doesn&rsquo;t belong and hidden it inside a property. Move that into the controller so you can wrangle it in
and populate the view model conciously.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to point out that implementing proper unit tests would uncover issues like this; because you definitely can&rsquo;t intercept calls to something like that and then you&rsquo;d realize injecting a repository into a view model is probably not something you want to be doing.</p>

<h3>3. Use partials and child actions to your advantage</h3>

<p>If you need to perform business logic in a view, that should be a sign you need to revisit your view model and logic.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s advisable to do this in your MVC Razor view:</p>

<p>```c#
@{</p>

<pre><code>var blogController = new BlogController();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<ul>
@foreach(var tag in blogController.GetTagsForPost(p.Id)) {
    <li>@tag.Name</li>
}
</ul>


<p>```</p>

<p>Putting business logic in the view is a no-no, but on top of that you&rsquo;re creating a <em>controller</em>! Move that into your action method and use
that view model you made for what it&rsquo;s intended for. You can also move that logic into a separate action method that only gets called inside views
so you can cache it separately if needed.</p>

<p>```c#
//In the controller:</p>

<p>[ChildActionOnly]
[OutputCache(Duration=2000)]
public ActionResult TagsForPost(int postId) {</p>

<pre><code>return View();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>//In the view:</p>

<p>@{Html.RenderAction(&ldquo;TagsForPost&rdquo;, new { postId = p.Id });}
```</p>

<p>Notice the <code>ChildActionOnly</code> attribute. From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.childactiononlyattribute(v=vs.118).aspx">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any method that is marked with <code>ChildActionOnlyAttribute</code> can be called only with the <code>Action</code> or <code>RenderAction</code> HTML extension methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means people can&rsquo;t see your child action by manipulating the URL (if you&rsquo;re using the default route).</p>

<p>Partial views and child actions are useful tools in the MVC arsenal; use them to your advantage!</p>

<h3>4. Cache what matters</h3>

<p>Given the code smells above, what do you think will happen if you only cached your view model?</p>

<p>```c#
public ActionResult Index() {</p>

<pre><code>var homepageViewModel = HttpContext.Current.Cache["homepageModel"] as HomepageViewModel;

if (homepageViewModel == null) {
    homepageViewModel = new HomepageViewModel();
    homepageViewModel.RecentPosts = _blogRepository.GetNewestPosts(5);

    HttpContext.Current.Cache.Add("homepageModel", homepageViewModel, ...);

}

return View(homepageViewModel);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Nothing! There will not be any performance gain because you&rsquo;re accessing the data layer through a controller variable in the view and
through a property in the view model&hellip; caching the view model won&rsquo;t help anything.</p>

<p>Instead, consider caching the <em>output</em> of the MVC action instead:</p>

<p>```c#
[OutputCache(Duration=2000)]
public ActionResult Index() {</p>

<pre><code>var homepageViewModel = new HomepageViewModel();

homepageViewModel.RecentPosts = _blogRepository.GetNewestPosts(5);

return View(homepageViewModel);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Notice the handy <code>OutputCache</code> attribute. MVC supports ASP.NET Output Caching; use it to your advantage when it applies. If you are
going to cache the model, your model needs to essentially be a POCO with automatic (and read-only) properties&hellip; not something that calls other
repository methods.</p>

<p>As an added benefit, I haven&rsquo;t ever done this but you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg650661.aspx">implement different output caching providers</a> allowing you to cache on
AppFabric/NoSQL/anywhere if you ever needed it. MVC is super extensible.</p>

<h3>5. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to leverage your ORM</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not going to take advantage of your ORM&rsquo;s feature set, you are missing out. In the codebase
I was reviewing, they were using NHibernate but they weren&rsquo;t <em>using</em> it. They were totally missing out on <a href="http://nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html#querycriteria-projection">its advanced projection
capabilities</a> to solve some of these memory issues. Some of this stems from rigidity in using a &ldquo;repository pattern&rdquo; and some of it stems from lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of EF or NHibernate&rsquo;s features, your repositories can do a lot more than just use basic generic methods. They can shape and
return the data <em>you actually want</em> in your controllers, greatly simplifying your controller logic. Do yourself a favor and read through the ORM&rsquo;s documentation to get a handle on what it can offer.</p>

<p>I think when people adopt the repository pattern, it&rsquo;s almost like they pull down a shade over the bright light shining in from their ORM window. When I started playing with RavenDB, I <strong>got rid</strong> of my repository layer (in fact, my <em>entire data project</em>) and went full-metal using Raven queries in my application service layer with a little bit of extension methods to reuse query logic. I found that <em>a lot</em> of my logic was really context-specific and benefited from simply taking advantage of Raven&rsquo;s extensive features to project, shape, and batch my queries.</p>

<h4>That&rsquo;s just, like, your opinion man&hellip;</h4>

<p>If you think you can abstract your ORM, I challenge you to think about it differently. The ORM <em>is</em> your abstraction and if you believe swapping out your existing ORM with another ORM will be a piece of cake because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;abstracted&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d be surprised. That&rsquo;s what I thought too until I learned the hard way that switching to Raven really changed my entire codebase in ways I didn&rsquo;t expect. Your ORM doesn&rsquo;t only affect data access, it affects the domain and it affects your business logic, it even will have an effect on your UI. By removing the repository abstraction, I actually <em>reduced the overall complexity</em> of my data access code.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Common sense is not so common&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Or so my dad loves to remind me at times. Sometimes it just takes a good code review to remind oneself that what you thought everyone knew isn&rsquo;t the case; you probably learned it through experience or frantic Googling and just assumed other people already knew it.</p>

<p>I hope this helped someone else out!</p>
