    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was excited to give a talk at <a href="http://midwestjs.com">Midwest.js</a> about <a href="http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript">Demystifying TypeScript</a>. This is not the first time I&rsquo;ve given the talk, it&rsquo;s actually the <strong>fourth</strong> time. Instead of leaving it stale I revamped the theme and updated all the information to be current as of today&mdash;including information about <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel.js</a> and <a href="https://flowtype.org/">Flow</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to technical difficulties (no HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter!) the talk&rsquo;s <em>video</em> wasn&rsquo;t recorded. However, I was mic&rsquo;d and I did use SnagIt to record my screen, so we&rsquo;re hoping we can merge the audio and video tracks to generate a recording. If not, I may need to sit down and record audio for the talk.</p>

<p>I will update this post after the conference and let you know the status&mdash;let&rsquo;s hope we can get it working! Otherwise, I guess you just had to be there ;)</p>

<p>If you attended and have questions, feel free to leave them here or <a href="http://twitter.com/kamranayub">tweet</a> at me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update (4/20/16)</strong>: The presentation is now up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeh-FcC6Sew">YouTube</a> (and <a href="http://kamranicus.com/presentations/typescript-in-action/#/">the slides</a>).</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ll be speaking at 8:30am this weekend at <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a>. My talk will about using TypeScript
in the context of an Angular 2 ASP.NET MVC web application but will focus on how TypeScript enhances my productivity and showcases some features of the language. I&rsquo;ve done the talk previously internally at General Mills and had a great response so I thought I&rsquo;d piggyback on the success of my previous <a href="http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript/#/">Demystifying TypeScript</a> talk (which is also on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb7tvaBJeMs">YouTube</a>).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re at all interested in seeing how TypeScript development looks in action, you should attend and I&rsquo;d recommend going through my
previous talk if you&rsquo;re still not convinced TypeScript is awesome. This talk assumes you are at least open to the idea of developing
in TypeScript and are curious to see how it can be used.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be a fun time and a busy weekend&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to leave the conference right after my talk to participate in Ludum Dare, where I&rsquo;ll
be helping to build a game in 72 hours. I&rsquo;m sad I&rsquo;ll miss the speaker happy hour and the prizes but it&rsquo;s for a good reason!
Hope to see you Saturday!</p>
