    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was excited to give a talk at <a href="http://midwestjs.com">Midwest.js</a> about <a href="http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript">Demystifying TypeScript</a>. This is not the first time I&rsquo;ve given the talk, it&rsquo;s actually the <strong>fourth</strong> time. Instead of leaving it stale I revamped the theme and updated all the information to be current as of today&mdash;including information about <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel.js</a> and <a href="https://flowtype.org/">Flow</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to technical difficulties (no HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter!) the talk&rsquo;s <em>video</em> wasn&rsquo;t recorded. However, I was mic&rsquo;d and I did use SnagIt to record my screen, so we&rsquo;re hoping we can merge the audio and video tracks to generate a recording. If not, I may need to sit down and record audio for the talk.</p>

<p>I will update this post after the conference and let you know the status&mdash;let&rsquo;s hope we can get it working! Otherwise, I guess you just had to be there ;)</p>

<p>If you attended and have questions, feel free to leave them here or <a href="http://twitter.com/kamranayub">tweet</a> at me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update (4/20/16)</strong>: The presentation is now up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeh-FcC6Sew">YouTube</a> (and <a href="http://kamranicus.com/presentations/typescript-in-action/#/">the slides</a>).</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ll be speaking at 8:30am this weekend at <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin Cities Code Camp</a>. My talk will about using TypeScript
in the context of an Angular 2 ASP.NET MVC web application but will focus on how TypeScript enhances my productivity and showcases some features of the language. I&rsquo;ve done the talk previously internally at General Mills and had a great response so I thought I&rsquo;d piggyback on the success of my previous <a href="http://kamranicus.com/presentations/demystifying-typescript/#/">Demystifying TypeScript</a> talk (which is also on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb7tvaBJeMs">YouTube</a>).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re at all interested in seeing how TypeScript development looks in action, you should attend and I&rsquo;d recommend going through my
previous talk if you&rsquo;re still not convinced TypeScript is awesome. This talk assumes you are at least open to the idea of developing
in TypeScript and are curious to see how it can be used.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be a fun time and a busy weekend&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to leave the conference right after my talk to participate in Ludum Dare, where I&rsquo;ll
be helping to build a game in 72 hours. I&rsquo;m sad I&rsquo;ll miss the speaker happy hour and the prizes but it&rsquo;s for a good reason!
Hope to see you Saturday!</p>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/03/11/attending-build-2016/"/>

    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/03/11/attending-build-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love attending conferences. At the end of the month I&rsquo;ll be attending <a href="http://buildwindows.com">Build 2016</a>. Build is the annual Microsoft conference. At the end of January me and some friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBJQ-PTuIzZ">attended PAX South</a> in San Antonio and it was a blast (not for work). A gaming convention has a different air than a developer conference. There&rsquo;s a certain energy and it&rsquo;s very motivating being around fellow developers, learning new tech, and seeing what&rsquo;s new. I&rsquo;ve attended Build several times in the past and it&rsquo;s always been fun&mdash;especially <a href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/posts/7/mix-11-day-2-kinects-celebrities-kings-and-clubbin/">when you meet coding &ldquo;celebs&rdquo;</a>. Usually I take my wife even though she doesn&rsquo;t attend the conference, we will typically stay longer. This year, not only will she be joining but our friend will be coming as well&mdash;both of them will be traipsing around San Francisco while I and a few coworkers will attend the conference. My partners in crime, <a href="http://twitter.com/erikonarheim">Erik</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/alangrgic">Alan</a>, will be joining me so it&rsquo;ll be a <em>ton</em> of fun (yes, we all work together and yes we <em>just</em> went to PAX together). Going to a conference is fun, going to a conference <em>with your friends</em> is even more fun.</p>

<p>After Build we&rsquo;ll be leaving my coworkers behind and we&rsquo;ll be flying up to Portland to explore the area. I&rsquo;ve been to downtown Seattle for PAX Prime before but I&rsquo;ve only been in the surrounding area once when I was a teenager and I always thought it was beautiful. My wife never has been to the Pacific northwest so we thought it&rsquo;d be fun to spend a few days extra and drive around. We&rsquo;re all looking forward to it.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re at Build and you follow me, be sure to <a href="http://twitter.com/kamranayub">send me a tweet</a> and we&rsquo;ll meet up!</p>
