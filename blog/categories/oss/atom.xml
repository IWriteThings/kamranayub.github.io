    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2016/05/08/cassette-subresource-integrity-sri</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a>, it&rsquo;s a browser-based security measure to protect embedded content like scripts and stylesheets using a file content hash to help protect against XSS attacks.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re including a script from a CDN:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://mycdn.com/jquery/1.0/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then let&rsquo;s say the CDN is compromised and instead of returning jquery, the script returns some malicious code that could compromise your site. Even if you&rsquo;re using Content Security Policy (CSP), you won&rsquo;t be protected because you whitelisted the CDN.</p>

<p>Subresource Integrity allows you to put a hash of the file&rsquo;s contents in an attribute of the tag. The browser will then hash the contents of the response from the CDN and compare it against the attribute provided. If the hashes don&rsquo;t match, the browser won&rsquo;t include the response and will throw an error.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://mycdn.com/jquery/1.0/jquery.js" integrity="sha256-hfhsh02929fhgh303yg"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Integrating with Cassette</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://getcassette.net">Cassette</a> to perform my bundling/minification and I also <a href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/2015/10/10/azure-cdn-cassette/">host my assets on a CDN</a>. Even though they are my own assets, I still want to ensure they are served securely and take advantage of SRI.</p>

<p>For third-party scripts, it is fairly easy to take advantage of SRI by <a href="https://srihash.org/">hashing the contents online</a> and customizing the CDN reference in Cassette:</p>

<pre><code>bundles.AddUrl("http://mycdn.com/jquery/1.0/jquery.js", bundle =&gt;
    bundle.HtmlAttributes.Add("integrity", "sha256-jquerysfilehash"));
</code></pre>

<p>But since my <em>own</em> files are dynamic, how can we still leverage Cassette <em>and</em> automatically hash the file contents when outputting to the page?</p>

<p>Luckily, Cassette is pretty extensible and includes a way to <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/v2/bundle-pipelines">customize the bundle pipeline</a>. So what we can do is essentially override the rendering of the HTML and add the <code>integrity</code> tag to the output.</p>

<p>To make this easy, I&rsquo;ve created an open source Nuget package called <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/cassette-sri">Cassette.SubresourceIntegrity</a>. All you do is install the package and <strong>that&rsquo;s it.</strong> Since Cassette automatically scans for bundle customizations, all I did was implement a class <code>InsertIntoPipelineSubresourceIntegrity</code> and modify the pipeline to replace a couple parts with SRI-aware code.</p>

<p>The meat of the change is this code here:</p>

<pre><code>string integrity;

using (var stream = asset.OpenStream())
{
    using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
    {
        integrity = $"integrity=\"sha256-{Convert.ToBase64String(sha256.ComputeHash(stream))}\"";
    }
}

return $"&lt;script src=\"{_urlGenerator.CreateAssetUrl(asset)}\" " +
       $"type=\"text/javascript\" " +
       $"{integrity}{bundle.HtmlAttributes.ToAttributeString()}&gt;&lt;/script&gt;";
</code></pre>

<p>I am just getting the asset stream and hashing the contents using SHA256, then adding the attribute to the output. You&rsquo;ll notice that the <strong>URLs are not changed</strong>, so Cassette will continue to use SHA1 hashes internally. It&rsquo;s <em>only when rendering</em> we use SHA256 because that&rsquo;s the only place we need it.</p>

<p>While the code is interesting, it&rsquo;s nothing too crazy&mdash;in fact, most of the code required is because Cassette doesn&rsquo;t expose certain needed classes used in the rendering pipeline so I had to basically copy/paste a lot of the helper classes.</p>

<h2>The end result</h2>

<p>Now Cassette will automatically include SRI hashes for individual assets:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="cassette.axd/asset/Content/bootstrap/bootstrap-ext.css?cabc6264a89106c4b9021c293cfa5c2cae7a0549"

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/2015/05/25/knockout-binding-report/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-25T10:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2015/05/25/knockout-binding-report</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use a lot of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout.js</a> on <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>. I love Knockout but sometimes it makes it difficult to understand what&rsquo;s slowing my page down.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>For the game list, there&rsquo;s a lot of binding going on because I have to bind not only the list of games but also the toolbar.</p>

<p><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/fefa8f95951ed13a2f4d22e758bb807b/tumblr_inline_nonu62Tr1J1qlpzxk_540.png" alt="KTOMG list" /></p>

<p>Before I deploy the newest update (shown above), I&rsquo;d prefer it if the list binding performance was better than it is now. Currently there&rsquo;s a visible block on the UI thread when returning results from the API, about 500-1000ms. <strong>This is unacceptable.</strong></p>

<p>A quick Google search did not yield anything regarding a &ldquo;real&rdquo; performance tool for Knockout. What I would love is an extension that would overlay performance statistics over the UI of my app after binding is complete. This way I could visualize and easily pinpoint what bindings are causing performance issues.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a small step towards that dream by creating a simple reporting script that outputs a &ldquo;binding report&rdquo; to the Chrome console:</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7795861/5a10389a-02d9-11e5-9462-056fa9e4da18.png" alt="Binding report" /></p>

<p>The report displays the total duration of the binding process (which is all bindings that occur after a 500ms wait time) as well as the top binding according to total duration.</p>

<p>It also displays each binding summary in a table (<code>console.table</code>). You can drill-down by expanding the array entries underneath the table (sorted by duration).</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7795969/8fb1c828-02da-11e5-8b81-fe88f466812e.png" alt="Drill-down" /></p>

<p>The script works by wrapping all the binding handlers (even custom ones) in a wrapper function that calculates the duration of the call to <code>init</code> or <code>update</code>. You just need to include it after your custom binding handlers and before the <code>applyBindings</code> call.</p>

<p>The script requires <a href="http://underscorejs.org">Underscore</a> and Google Chrome. Here&rsquo;s the gist:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/65399fa247a6c182bc65.js"></script>


<p>As you can see in my own performance report, I have some work to do to fix my <code>if</code> bindings. It doesn&rsquo;t exactly pinpoint the problem binding, but it gets me a step closer to understanding what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7796086/f407dc76-02db-11e5-90e7-b89613408174.png" alt="Uh oh" /></p>

<p>Now if you&rsquo;ll execuse me, I&rsquo;ve got some work to do.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Using this little script, I was able to get down to &lt;150ms from 600-900ms (and this is a slow laptop). This is much more acceptable for a release this week!</p>

    <updated>2015-05-11T16:20:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2015/05/11/extending-knockout-with-urlsync</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made a tiny Knockout extender called <code>urlSync</code> that syncs an observable with the URL.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>For <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a> I&rsquo;ve been adding filtering to the game library.
I&rsquo;m really proud of what I have, here&rsquo;s what it looks like in the UI:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2015-05-11-filtering.png" alt="Filtering UI" /></p>

<p>A modal allows the user to drill down and pick what filters to apply, the modal updates to show what filters are applied and what&rsquo;s available with the current resultset.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2015-05-11-filtering-modal.png" alt="Filtering Modal" /></p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re outside the modal, I show any filters being applied allowing one-click removal or toggling the filtering method between AND/OR.</p>

<p>To make it easy to serialize/deserialize filters, I created a custom filtering expression that is pretty standard around town:</p>

<pre><code>{facetName}:{facetValue},{facetValue},...|...
</code></pre>

<p>For example, representing the screenshot above, the filtering expression would be:</p>

<pre><code>Lists:6|Status:8|My+Platforms:1
</code></pre>

<p>If you muck with the expression, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any issues. Facets are validated against whatever the original unfiltered resultset is, so you cannot add arbitrary expressions&mdash;if you do, they will not show up in the server response. Strings are special because potentially they can include characters used to parse the expression, the simplest way to deal with it is by encoding them and then decoding the value.</p>

<pre><code>Tags:my%20awesome%2ctag,tag2|Status:4
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I wanted to talk about the filtering expression because it makes it really easy to do a bunch of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reading/writing from querystring or hash</li>
<li>Create a command textbox that can parse and autocomplete expressions</li>
<li>Allow the user to save &ldquo;views&rdquo; of their games</li>
</ol>


<p>Items 2 and 3 might be on the agenda for some later date but item 1 is required for being able to create pre-filtered routes or create links. Since the library is loaded through Knockout and Web API, we need to be able to pass any filter or parameters when the page is loaded and also keep track of what the current values are for filtering.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I created a really simple <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/extenders.html">Knockout Extender</a> called <strong>urlSync.</strong> All it does is initially load an observable from the hash (if found) or the querystring (if found). Then it observes the observable and keeps the <code>window.location.hash</code> updated.</p>

<p>This could easily be extended to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history">HTML5 <code>pushState</code></a>, if you wished. For now, managing the hash is &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for my use case.</p>

<p>Here is a Gist of the extender:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/3feba45dd2da3262b872.js"></script>


<p>It depends on <a href="http://medialize.github.io/URI.js">URI.js</a> and the <a href="http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/docs.html#fragment-abuse">URI.fragmentQuery</a> component. It also uses <a href="http://underscorejs.org">Underscore.js</a>, but that&rsquo;s just because I have it in my project already.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really simple to use, for example here&rsquo;s a snippet from my collection view model:</p>

<p>```
// Flattened facets
ViewModel.facets = ko.observableArray([]);</p>

<p>// Selected (applied) facets
ViewModel.selectedFacets = ko.observableArray([]).extend({</p>

<pre><code>urlSync: {
    param: "filterBy",
    read: function(value) {
       return kt.utils.facetsFromString(value, ViewModel.facets);
    },
    write: kt.utils.facetsToString
}
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>// Filter AND toggle
ViewModel.filterAnd = ko.observable(false).extend({ urlSync: &ldquo;filterAnd&rdquo; });
```</p>

<p>As you can see, the extender allows you to intercept read/write so you can perform any custom transformations (e.g. filtering objects to/from string). Because we&rsquo;re deserializing from a string and because the <code>checkedValue</code> binding is by reference, I pass in the existing facets collection to my utility, in order to preserve object references when required. On initial page load, this isn&rsquo;t required as the games haven&rsquo;t been fetched from the API yet. Once they are, my fetch method updates the observables. I could also modify the way I handle binding the checkboxes but this works.</p>

<p>The <code>urlSync</code> extender will then bind the observable values to the URL like this:</p>

<pre><code>users/kamran.ayub/lists/all#?
    sortBy=Name&amp;
    filterAnd=true&amp;
    filterBy=Status%3A8%7CLists%3A6%7CMy+Platforms%3A1
</code></pre>

<p>Since the extender can also fallback to reading from the querystring, we can create URLs that filter a user&rsquo;s collection:</p>

<pre><code>users/somebody/lists/all?filterBy=Platforms:2,5,40
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty neat and now allows anyone to copy/paste the URL and preserve any needed filtering state!</p>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/2013/12/05/miniprofiler-ravendb-pull-request-accepted/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-05T14:32:08+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2013/12/05/miniprofiler-ravendb-pull-request-accepted</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got a notification that my <a href="https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet/pull/15">pull request</a> for
adding RavenDB support to MiniProfiler went through! It&rsquo;s always really cool to see your contributions
get pulled in. The MiniProfiler guys were really easy-going, <a href="https://github.com/yellis">@yellis</a> was even kind enough to take on
the testing. That kind of acceptance for pull requests is great to see because it makes me feel good
about contributing and is a bit less intimidating.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>The &ldquo;official&rdquo; MiniProfiler RavenDB plugin does several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integrates with all existing MiniProfiler settings</li>
<li>Displays the query duration just like you&rsquo;d expect in a separate raven column

<ul>
<li>This let&rsquo;s you see the raven percentage individually just like SQL</li>
<li>It matches the experience of using EF with MiniProfiler exactly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allows you to dig into the exact request details ala EF integration</li>
<li>(not included) It&rsquo;s possible to also include the <em>results</em> of the request but in my pull request I don&rsquo;t because it was way too much
overhead to include the full response in the web interface (displaying 50 complex objects in JSON slowed down the UI too much)

<ul>
<li>You can just copy the query to see the results in Raven Studio anyway</li>
<li>Possibly you could just display the query URL and open the request in a new tab</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I have only just begun my exploration of RavenDB but one of the downsides from moving from EF was
the excellent MiniProfiler integration. I was really surprised to find adding the same level
of support to Raven was pretty straightforward in the latest iteration of MiniProfiler.</p>

<p>There are two packages I found that added profiling to Raven, the <a href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/tree/master/Raven.Client.MvcIntegration">&ldquo;official&rdquo; Raven profiler</a> and another
<a href="http://blog.csainty.com/MvcMiniProfiler.RavenDb/">MiniProfiler plugin</a>, but both of those are lacking. The official one didn&rsquo;t seem to handle AJAX requests
and the other only seemed to add profiling steps; it didn&rsquo;t provide any details about the request.
I wanted <strong>full</strong> integration with MiniProfiler on the same level as EF and I didn&rsquo;t want to enable <em>two</em> profilers at once. I was
already using MiniProfiler to profile my MVC app, I didn&rsquo;t want to enable Raven Profiler and MiniProfiler
at the same time.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb.contrib/tree/master/src/Raven.Client.Contrib.Profiling">a RavenDb.Contrib project</a> that added MiniProfiler integration on the level I wanted, but unfortunately it was not integrated
tightly into the MiniProfiler codebase (it was using reflection and other hacks) and it also was not built against the latest version of the codebase
that simplified the steps to create a new custom timing. Still, credit is due, because some of the formatting logic and general direction of my pull
request was taken from that contrib project.</p>

<p>I do not know what the release schedule is like for the next version of MiniProfiler, but I have my
RavenDB-based branch compiled and am using it for my site currently. You can bring down my fork
and compile it yourself too, if you&rsquo;re really interested in using it right now.</p>
