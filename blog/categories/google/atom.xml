    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re an app or site developer, you&rsquo;ve probably got a bunch of
tabs or bookmarks for your dashboards, social network accounts,
blog, and more. For <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>,
I have UserVoice, Azure, RavenDB, social profiles, etc. that I
need to manage and track (haha).</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>It can be a chore to manage all of this easily but I have a tip.
A little while back Chrome <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en">introduced a new feature</a> that lets
you switch between multiple profiles super easily. I use it
for me and my wife, since she has a Google account and goes
to knitting sites and does whatever she likes doing&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want that filth in <em>my</em> Chrome instance! :)</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7749041/784a45e2-ffca-11e4-8a5f-ce5d1c445d4e.png" alt="Chrome user switcher is in the corner" /></p>

<p>The user switcher is in the top-right of Chrome, shown above. You can single-click to bring up a modal or right-click to quickly switch.
Chrome profiles are kept separate, with their own settings, extensions,
and bookmarks. This keeps tabs and work separated neatly and creates a
so-called &ldquo;separation of concerns&rdquo; for your browsing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub: A full Chrome user is tied to a Google account. I don&rsquo;t want to create a separate Google account just for KTOMG.
The Google+, YouTube, email, etc. is all linked to my primary Google Account.
The issue is, Chrome will not let more than one
Google account exist on a single PC. So how can we take advantage of the profile separation but still
keep my primary Google account?</p>

<p>The answer is: we&rsquo;ll create a
<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3463947">Supervised User Account</a>. Did you notice I said &ldquo;full user&rdquo; before?
A SUA is just a lower privilege profile (meant for children) that you can
control via your primary Google account. BUT, if you <strong>don&rsquo;t restrict anything</strong>,
it&rsquo;ll just be like a &ldquo;full&rdquo; profile!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll follow the instructions above in the Google help article:</p>

<ol>
<li>Under your Chrome profile, go to Settings</li>
<li>Scroll down to Users</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Add User&rdquo; and enter your app&rsquo;s name and avatar for a picture</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Control and view websites this person visits from [your Google account]&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7749183/8dd90398-ffcb-11e4-8f8a-095f4a2e4beb.png" alt="Supervised user" /></p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;ve made a &ldquo;supervised&rdquo; app account managed by your main Google one. Nice! You can set up all your tabs as you want, <del>extensions with any
specific accounts (TweetDeck)</del>, and pinned dashboard tabs, all within a separate context from your primary Chrome profile. <strong>Update:</strong> It appears, after I tried, that SUA&rsquo;s cannot use extensions. There&rsquo;s an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=354178">open issue</a> for it, so hopefully whitelist ability will be added soon.</p>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s what <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a>
looks like in its own Chrome profile:</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7749251/1de36eb0-ffcc-11e4-8be9-fa78b45a69da.png" alt="KTOMG profile" /></p>

<p>And the full experience:</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/7749724/e2d07ed6-ffcf-11e4-93cd-f307718c2c82.png" alt="KTOMG browser" /></p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re the only one managing a bunch of apps, this
is a real productivity booster. You could even go as far as
creating separate profiles for each environment, if you like. Hell, this doesn&rsquo;t have to be for apps, it could be for whatever browsing contexts you want to separate.</p>

<p>Just make sure you have enough RAM because Chrome will
suck it all up.</p>

<p>Dumb puny laptop.</p>

<p>Hope this helps! Happy managing.</p>
