    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m starting to introduce privacy controls to <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a> and I ran into the following scenario when writing my tests:</p>

<p>```
Scenario: Anonymous user should be able to view a public custom list</p>

<pre><code>Given a user has a list
And a user's list is public
When I request access to the list
Then I have read-only access
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In this context, <strong>I</strong> am the anonymous user. This is the exact <a href="http://www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> scenario I wrote. Do you know why I may have run into issues?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the first two steps:</p>

<p>```c#
[Given(@&ldquo;a user has a list&rdquo;)]
public void GivenAUserHasAList() {</p>

<pre><code>_listResult = _context.ListService.CreateList(_newList)
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>[Given(@&ldquo;a user&rsquo;s list is public&rdquo;)]
public void GivenAUsersListIsPublic() {
  <em>privacySettings.Level = PrivacyLevel.Public;
  </em>context.ListService.UpdateListPrivacy(<em>listResult.Id, </em>privacySettings);
}
```</p>

<p>Why would this cause a problem with my given scenario?</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first step, I&rsquo;m creating a new list.</li>
<li>In the second step, I&rsquo;m taking the new list I just made from the first step and updating the privacy settings on it.</li>
</ol>


<p>The problem is that my service assumes the context is an authenticated user and will apply changes to the <strong>current user&rsquo;s</strong> list. Well, since I did not call my login helpers before these two steps, I am in an anonymous context so the service calls fail. That&rsquo;s good! But how can I tell my steps to call a service method <em>on behalf</em> of another user without having <em>every</em> step use the current user context?</p>

<p>You might say I should just create a new method that accepts a username and refactor my methods. I <em>could</em> do that but not only is my entire service designed around the current user context, my service layer is essentially the interface of my public API. I would never allow one user to create a list for another user (unless that was a feature). So the same way I wouldn&rsquo;t expose an API method to do something on behalf of someone, I won&rsquo;t add a public method in my service layer to do the same. I could choose to make the method private or internal and grant access to the assembly for testing&mdash;true, I <em>could</em> but that seems like a workaround where I need to expose special functionality just for testing.</p>

<p>The approach I ended up doing was simpler and more elegant and leveraged an existing pattern I was relying on: injecting an <code>IUserContext</code> into my service layer like this:</p>

<p><code>c#
public ListService(IUserContext userContext) {
  _userContext = userContext;
}
</code></p>

<p>This is using standard dependency injection (Ninject, in my case) to inject a context for the current user. That context gets created and maintained outside this class, so it doesn&rsquo;t care who provided it or where it came from, it just uses it to determine business logic.</p>

<p>So since I&rsquo;m already injecting the current user context and mocking it in my tests, why not simply swap out the context when I need to?</p>

<h2>Creating an impersonation context</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I ended up doing. Here&rsquo;s my implementation of a <code>TestingImpersonationContext</code> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/9654d6581fbcf63cf481">https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/9654d6581fbcf63cf481</a>):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/9654d6581fbcf63cf481.js"></script>


<p>It should be clear what&rsquo;s happening but let me explain further. Specifically in SpecFlow you can inject a context into your testing steps like so:</p>

<p>```c#
public class StepBase : TechTalk.SpecFlow.Steps {</p>

<pre><code>protected TestingContext _context;
public StepBase(TestingContext context)
{
    _context = context;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>As long as your step classes inherit that <code>StepBase</code>, you have access to a context. All I did was build a method off that context that swapped out my existing dependency that was injected for <code>IUserContext</code> with a temporary context that impersonated the requested user. Once it is disposed, it restores the original context. Easy as pie!</p>

<p>If you are <strong>not</strong> using SpecFlow which is probably the case, don&rsquo;t fret&mdash;all you really need is a class or helper method that you can access in your test classes. However you want to achieve that is up to you. Create a base class, don&rsquo;t even bother with dependency injection, etc. This is entirely doable without DI but since my app relies on it I also leverage it during testing.</p>

<p>Now given we have an impersonation context helper, here&rsquo;s how our two testing steps have changed:</p>

<p>```c#
[Given(@&ldquo;a user has a list&rdquo;)]
public void GivenAUserHasAList() {
  using (_context.Impersonate(&ldquo;user&rdquo;) {</p>

<pre><code>_listResult = _context.ListService.CreateList(_newList);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>[Given(@&ldquo;a user&rsquo;s list is public&rdquo;)]
public void GivenAUsersListIsPublic() {</p>

<pre><code>using (_context.Impersonate("user"))
{
    _privacySettings.Level = PrivacyLevel.Public;
    _context.ListService.UpdateListPrivacy(_listResult.Id, _privacySettings);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>I could even update my scenario to be specific about <strong>who&rsquo;s list</strong> I&rsquo;m accessing (so it&rsquo;s not ambiguous between logged in user vs. another user) but since I only have two users in my testing context, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p>Now for the test results:</p>

<p><code>
Given a user has a list
-&gt; done: ListSteps.GivenAUserHasAList() (0.2s)
And a user's list is public
-&gt; done: ListSteps.GivenAUsersListIsPublic() (0.0s)
When I request access to the list
-&gt; done: ListSteps.WhenIRequestAccessToTheList() (0.1s)
Then I have read-only access
-&gt; done: ListSteps.ThenIHaveReadAccess() (0.0s)
</code></p>

<p>The tests are green and now I&rsquo;m a happy coder. By the way, if you aren&rsquo;t using <a href="http://specflow.org">SpecFlow</a> for .NET you should consider it, I love it.</p>

    <link href="http://kamranicus.com/blog/2015/10/10/azure-cdn-cassette/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-10T00:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamranicus.com/blog/2015/10/10/azure-cdn-cassette</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the October update for <a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a> I wanted to offload my web assets to a CDN. Since I&rsquo;m already using <a href="http://azure.com">Microsoft Azure</a> to host the site, I decided to use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cdn/">Azure CDN</a>.</p>

<p>I set it up for &ldquo;Origin Pull&rdquo; which means that instead of uploading my assets to the CDN (Azure Blob storage), you request a file from the CDN and Azure will go and get it from your website and then cache it on their servers.</p>

<p>So as an example:</p>

<p><code>
User requests http://az888888.vo.msecnd.net/stylesheets/foo.png
|
|
CDN: have I cached "stylesheets/foo.png?"
  Yes: Serve content from edge cache (closest to user)
  No: Request http://yourwebsites.com/stylesheets/foo.png and serve
</code></p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cdn-create-new-endpoint/">how to set up origin pull in Azure CDN</a>. In my case, I used &ldquo;Custom Origin&rdquo; of &ldquo;<a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">http://keeptrackofmygames.com</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Using CDN with Cassette</h2>

<p>I use the .NET library <a href="http://getcassette.com">Cassette</a> for bundling &amp; minification for KTOMG&mdash;when I started KTOMG there was no Microsoft provided option and Cassette has been really stable.</p>

<p>It works pretty much as you&rsquo;d expect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define &ldquo;bundles&rdquo; which are sets of scripts/stylesheets</li>
<li>Render bundles onto page(s)</li>
<li>If debug mode, render individually otherwise minify and concatenate</li>
</ul>


<p>By default, Cassette will render URLs like this in your source code:</p>

<p>In debug mode:</p>

<p>```
Bundle: ~/Content/core</p>

<ul>
<li>/cassette.axd/asset/Content/bootstrap.css?hash</li>
<li>/cassette.axd/asset/Content/site.css?hash</li>
<li>/cassette.axd/asset/Content/app.css?hash
```</li>
</ul>


<p>And in production:</p>

<p><code>
/cassette.axd/stylesheet/{hash}/Content/core
</code></p>

<p>But if we want to serve assets over the CDN, we need to plug in our special CDN URL prefix&mdash;not only for script/stylesheet references but also references to images <em>in</em> those files.</p>

<p>Luckily, Cassette provides a facility to modify generated URLs by letting you register a <code>IUrlGenerator</code>. Here&rsquo;s my full implementation of this for my CDN:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kamranayub/2da4ccfec3e7812c8367.js"></script>


<p>As you can see, I register a custom <code>IUrlGenerator</code> and a custom <code>IUrlModifier</code>. The default <code>IUrlModifider</code> is Cassette&rsquo;s <code>VirtualDirectoryPrepender</code> and it just prepends &ldquo;/&rdquo; to the beginning of every URL but in our case we want to conditionally prepend the Azure CDN endpoint in production.</p>

<p>In production, this will produce the following output:</p>

<p><code>
https://az99999.vo.msecnd.net/cassette.axd/stylesheet/{hash}/Content/core
</code></p>

<p>To allow local debugging and CDN in production I just use an app setting in the web.config. In Azure, I also add an application setting (<code>CdnUrl</code>) through the portal in my production slot with the correct CDN URL and voila&mdash;all my assets will now be served over CDN.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Azure CDN does not yet support HTTPS for custom origin domains. So if you want to serve content over <a href="http://static.yoursite.com">http://static.yoursite.com</a> you can&rsquo;t serve it over HTTPS because Azure doesn&rsquo;t allow you to upload or set a SSL certificate to use and insteads uses their own certificate which is not valid for your domain. <a href="http://feedback.azure.com/forums/169397-cdn/suggestions/1332683-allow-https-for-custom-cdn-domain-names">Vote up the UserVoice issue</a> on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Azure CDN origin pull does not seem to respect <code>Cache-Control: private</code> HTTP header. For example, by default MVC serves pages with private cache control which means browsers won&rsquo;t cache that page and neither <em>should</em> Azure CDN&mdash;but it does anyway. In my case, I really don&rsquo;t want a true mirror of my site, I just wants assets served over CDN and Cassette sets <code>Cache-Control: public</code> on them automatically. <a href="http://feedback.azure.com/forums/169397-cdn/suggestions/10148280-respect-cache-control-private-for-origin-pull">You can upvote my feature request on UserVoice</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I am choosing <strong>not</strong> to point my entire domain to the CDN. Some folks choose to serve their entire site over the CDN which is definitely something you can do. However, in my case, I didn&rsquo;t want to do that. If you instead chose to point your domain to the CDN endpoint, you don&rsquo;t need to do any of this&mdash;<strong>everything</strong> will be served over the CDN.</p></li>
</ul>
