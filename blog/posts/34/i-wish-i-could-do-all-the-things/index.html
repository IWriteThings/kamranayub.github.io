        </div>
        <p>Do you ever have the problem where you have so many &ldquo;cool&rdquo; ideas you want to work on, but don&rsquo;t have enough time? When I started out in web development, I had a ton of time, being a high school student. I ran out of ideas by the time I was in college, but now after some time working &ldquo;in the real world,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve lately had a torrent of ideas that I wish I could spend time on. For some, I&rsquo;ve started on them, but I find it hard to make time for them.</p>

<h2>The Ideas</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a rundown of all the ideas in my head that I wish I could spend time on:</p>

<ul>
<li>A web-based multiplayer game (I have started working on this)</li>
<li>A web app related to coding (I started it a little)</li>
<li>A web site (just ideas written down)</li>
<li>A project for work (I started a little)</li>
<li>A crazy idea for an app (IDE?) for writing code (yah, right, I&rsquo;ll never be able to do this&hellip; unless it was web-based)</li>
<li>A GitHub-style front-end for TFS because TFS is not social</li>
<li><a href="http://keeptrackofmygames.com">Keep Track of My Games</a> (v1 finished, but wish I could work on v2)</li>
<li><a href="http://getcassette.net">Cassette</a> for Node.js

<ul>
<li>I have no idea if this makes sense for Node, but I&rsquo;ve found existing asset management packages not as easy to use as Cassette</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>You can be sure there&rsquo;s more but these are off the top of my head.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s blocking?</h2>

<p>Is it totally true I don&rsquo;t have time to work on these? Not exactly. My problem is that having two really big hobbies (gaming + development) and having to work in one hobby (development) conflict with each other. After coming home from developing all day, I am sometimes motivated to work hard on an idea for a few hours (or all night) but that quickly turns to me being burnt out and I have a hard time recovering from it to continue being motivated to work on an idea. More often, I want to relax and play some games or spend time with friends.</p>

<p>The other issue is that my idea list and what I <em>want</em> for each of these ideas quickly turns into a humongous wish list and I start to doubt I can even begin to finish the list. I&rsquo;ve done enough &ldquo;agile&rdquo; development at work to realize I can prioritize and start small and then iterate, which is what I did with KTOMG but then I have so many other ideas, it still feels like too much.</p>

<p>Money is also an issue. I want to implement this and that, but it&rsquo;s going to cost <em>me</em> money to do it. I have loans to pay off (thanks, education), a car to payoff, and rent to pay, not to mention daily or life expenses. I already spend quite a bit and KTOMG still costs me a fair amount to keep running (especially now that AppHarbor has $10 custom domains and $20 SSL). Partly that is dictated by technology, right? I could write everything in PHP and pay for cheap hosting, but I like being a .NET developer and lately I like being a Node/JS developer. Furthermore, complex ideas sometimes need complex hosting. KTOMG has a scheduled job but because I&rsquo;m cheap, it&rsquo;s not a background worker&hellip; it&rsquo;s a scheduled URL request to a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; URL that initiates a 2 minute job. My database is hosted at a different host, which makes the site slower because it&rsquo;s expensive to host SQL Server on AppHarbor.</p>

<p>If an idea I had were to generate revenue, and several of my ideas I&rsquo;m working on <em>could</em>, expenses would be less of an issue. When I released TorrentTyphoon, hosting was cheap and the site paid for itself (I think during my 4 years of high school I made around $10,000 in freelance and ad revenue). The main issue is that I still need to pay for the idea while I&rsquo;m developing it or testing it, and what happens if I release it and it goes nowhere? I&rsquo;m the one who has to pay for it.</p>

<h2>So what&rsquo;s the solution?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that if I <em>force myself to start</em> working on an idea, I will be carried off and will work on it continuously for awhile. The hard part is actually sitting down and opening up the project. For KTOMG, I said to myself that I&rsquo;d spend an hour a day for a week working on the site. What happened was that &ldquo;hour&rdquo; turned into several hours and it was really fun. The reward was making an app that actually accomplished what I wanted. Then the ideas started getting bigger (make it AJAX, support multiple release dates, let me organize, let me tag, etc. etc.) and it&rsquo;s almost as if I became scared to work on it&hellip; for fear of it taking so much time; <em>plus</em> those features were not the core of what I wanted for myself, and if I don&rsquo;t really want to use them, what&rsquo;s the motivation for me to implement them? There are around 80 people that use the site&hellip; and it does <em>exactly what I need it to</em>. It&rsquo;s hard for me to justify spending time adding more features, <em>even though I realize deep down it&rsquo;ll attract more users.</em></p>

<p>What I have had luck with is creating and working on tiny ideas. DotJson was a tiny idea. My latest UnderscoreKO was a tiny idea. This site was a tiny idea. These ideas are 1 week projects or less and they have a finite end, which I seem to do better on. They are spawned because <em>I</em> want to use them and I make them public so others can too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned, as I related above, that &ldquo;chunked&rdquo; development works well for me. Spend an hour a day, or aim to spend 5 hours a week, if I make the goal small, I tend to have more fun which makes me more motivated. If I start to see a working prototype or actual result, it snowballs until I finish something consumable. The other thing that motivates me pretty well is doing something new; developing a game is not something I&rsquo;ve done before, and getting a chance to learn Node.js, Socket.io, and other new stuff is pretty fun.</p>

<p>The other thing that seems to help is working with someone else. Even if it&rsquo;s bouncing ideas, or including them in my repository, it becomes fun to work on an idea. So far I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to work with someone <em>coding-wise</em> on an idea, but I&rsquo;ve had the chance to do feature or mechanic work with other people. Everyone else is just as busy, or more busy, than I am.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the things I could do is to throw my ideas and all my documentation out there and let someone else run with it. The problem with that, is that I&rsquo;d be worried I wouldn&rsquo;t have a say in what happens or worse, would lose control of the idea. The last thing I want is for someone else to take my idea, not tell me, and then profit off of it. Perhaps that&rsquo;s a cynical point of view but it is something I worry about. For things that I know I probably don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to do or are just &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice?&rdquo; ideas, I don&rsquo;t mind sharing them (like some ideas I listed above).</p>

<p>Does anyone else have this problem? Have you had it and solved it? Do you have it and wish you could solve it? I&rsquo;m interested in knowing.</p>
