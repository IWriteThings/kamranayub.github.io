<div class="entry-content"><p>Inspired by a lot of the research and learning lately I&rsquo;ve been doing around experience design (which has always been a passion for me), I decided it might be fun to start sharing the little things I run into in daily life that frustrate me as a user or that give me some joy.</p>

<p>The big catalyst for deciding to do this was <a href="http://twitter.com/aral">Aral Balkan</a>&rsquo;s amazing keynote at the Norwegian Developer Conference 2012 in Oslo, Norway:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43524962" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43524962">NDC2012 &ndash; Opening and Keynote &ldquo;A happy grain of sand&rdquo; by Aral Balkan</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/ndcoslo">NDCOslo</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, <strong>you must watch it now</strong> if you do any development or design. It may just change how you think about what you do.</p>

<p>I may or may not commit to doing these kinds of posts each week, but I will try! Since Google+ instantly uploads my camera photos from my phone to my profile, I don&rsquo;t have much of an excuse not to share my feelings.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to say is that I want to approach this from the standpoint of a user, <strong>myself</strong> and how I felt. When something is frustrating, we like to blame ourselves. The fact is that in the majority (all?) cases, there&rsquo;s an aspect of bad design at work. When something makes us happy, we should take note of what it was that caused it!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, as it should cause you to take a deeper look at the things you use every day and question whether or not they show aspects of good or bad design.</p>

<h2>The Away Sign</h2>

<p>I went to work today to pick up some prints I requested (I will talk about the job request form in another post!). When I approached the print desk I was greeted with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qKsASX3hclo/T9tqFrwh4VI/AAAAAAAABTs/f-si5HCrjD8/s0-d/12%2B-%2B3" alt="Away" /></p>

<p>First off, this is better than nothing! At least I know that from the time I see this sign to 5 minutes from <em>now</em>, they should be back. This made me feel good.</p>

<p>What I want to point out is that <em>there&rsquo;s an even better option.</em></p>

<p>When I went shopping for a new place to live, we visited a ton of leasing offices. Rental agents have to give tours of the model or vacant apartments <em>every day</em> practically. It makes sense they should give feedback to people who arrive early to their appointments.</p>

<p>Can you guess what they did?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.littleclockshop.com/images/products/will_return_clock.jpg" alt="Be Back Clock" /><br/>
(Source: <a href="http://www.littleclockshop.com/images/products/will_return_clock.jpg">LittleClockShop</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Yes! That makes me happy!</strong> Not only do I know the folks are away, I know when to expect their return so I can plan accordingly: Do I wait in the car? Do I leave a message? Do I simply wait?</p>

<p>The problem with saying &ldquo;Be back in 5 minutes&rdquo; is that when a customer arrives, they don&rsquo;t know what 5 minutes means. The 5 minutes was relative to when you posted the sign, not relative to when a customer arrives. It&rsquo;s OK to not know the exact time you&rsquo;ll be back, but it&rsquo;s still better than a relative time.</p>

<h2>The IKEA Picture Frame</h2>

<p>I love IKEA. I understand that I will probably need to replace a lot of the things I buy from them in a year or two, but I like their philosophy.</p>

<p>I usually have no frustrating experiences with IKEA, even with their absurdly large <strike>warehouse</strike> store.</p>

<p>Today, however, was different. I needed to purchase low-cost 8.5x11&#8221; frames for a project I&rsquo;m doing. IKEA to the rescue! I found this great NYTTJIA frame for a measly $2:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50186500/"><img src="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/nyttja-frame__0109048_PE258703_S4.JPG" alt="Frame" /></a></p>

<p>Excellent. I headed over to my local IKEA store, ran in, and ran out with 8 of them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EjFXc7qBt3g/T9tqFi_vulI/AAAAAAAABT8/5Zmfp-o2yhc/s0-d/12%2B-%2B4" alt="What it looks like" /></p>

<p>Looks fine to me! Fast forward to when I arrived home and decided to put my pictures in the frames. The frames are wrapped in plastic, so I tore them off easily. I opened up the back of the frame, cool, this is easy. I get down to the included backing paper and take it out to reveal the laminate cover.</p>

<p>Then, what I saw made me get angry.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-T3cyOTpaGXU/T9tqFjcqpHI/AAAAAAAABUE/8PB5WqfG9JY/s0-d/12%2B-%2B2" alt="What the hell" /></p>

<p><strong>The plastic cover has stupid recycling symbols on it, rendering it completely useless for covering and protecting my photos.</strong></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look, shall we?</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LGe7iNqhtgs/T9tqFl3bTuI/AAAAAAAABUI/gK_o_XtJSjM/s0-d/12%2B-%2B1" alt="Ugh" /></p>

<p><strong>What. The. Hell.</strong></p>

<p>Why would you do this IKEA? WHY? I understand I paid $2 cheap dollars for this, but why render the plastic covering totally useless? I don&rsquo;t understand&hellip; am I supposed to assume I needed to buy coverings separately?</p>

<p>You <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50186500/">totally didn&rsquo;t make it seem that way</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Front protection in durable plastic; makes the frame safer to use.</p></blockquote>

<p>NO! NO IT DOES NOT! I can&rsquo;t use it! I would get stupid little symbols over my photo.</p>

<h3>Wait a second&hellip;</h3>

<p>When I originally wrote this post 5 minutes ago, I posted the story above. After re-reading it, a sudden thought occurred to me!</p>

<blockquote><p>What if it&rsquo;s just a thin covering?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, what have we here!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ABfUr6W62dY/T9t3jhZc7dI/AAAAAAAABUU/hXiHGWQPAgQ/s0-d/IMG_20120615_125721.jpg" alt="WHAT?" /></p>

<p>So it turns out my rage against this frame was misplaced. It turns out, IKEA <em>did</em> do something right: they protected their protective cover.</p>

<p>But now I want to talk about why this design sucks.</p>

<h3>My Mental Model</h3>

<p>So why would I make this mistake? Why didn&rsquo;t I realize that the symbols I saw when I bought the frame were on the plastic and not on the paper? Why didn&rsquo;t I realize right away it was only a thin covering I could peel off?</p>

<ol>
<li>In the store, I unconsciously assumed the symbols were on the paper, not the plastic</li>
<li>At home, I unconsciously assumed the symbols were printed on the plastic</li>
</ol>


<p>My mental model was based on past experiences with picture frames, all of which had included a plastic or glass cover that had no marks or symbols on them. There was no reason to suspect this frame would be any different.</p>

<p>The issue was that IKEA took it one step further, becoming clever. That cleverness translated into frustration for me when I didn&rsquo;t see the cleverness right away.</p>

<p>Now that we know what the problem was, is there a solution? I think so, it&rsquo;s called a hint! I think the standard term for this is an <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a></em>:</p>

<p><img src="/Blog/Posts/Image/54/Small" alt="Peel hint" /><br/>
Source: <a href="http://wpcornerpeelplugin.com/html/">http://wpcornerpeelplugin.com/html/</a></p>

<p>That is essentially all IKEA needed to do to prevent this problem. By folding a corner, providing a colored peel tab, or using any other myriad of techniques we see every day, they could have avoided my frustration and automatic assumption that they hated me.</p>

<h2>So there you have it</h2>

<p>One fairly pleasing experience, one frustrating experience and that was just this morning. Oh what fun me and you will have in the coming days! I will try to keep it balanced in each post, showcasing something that made me happy and something that did not.</p>

<p>If you came across something that made you happy or frustrated today, share it!</p>
