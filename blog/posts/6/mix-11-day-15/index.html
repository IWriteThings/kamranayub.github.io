        <p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever been to Vegas. I think that one guy on Twitter had it right, &ldquo;everything in Vegas is fake.&rdquo; That said, it&rsquo;s still pretty neat. We walked to the Bellagio last night and saw Celine Dion&rsquo;s water display. My heart <em>did</em> go on.</p>

<h2>Open Source Fest</h2>

<p>The open source fest went swimmingly. I had been afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t meet anyone or no one would like <a href="http://github.com/kamranayub/.JSON">my library</a> but that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>

<p>I met John Sheehan from <a href="http://restsharp.org/">RestSharp</a>, Sam Saffron and other developers from Stackoverflow, Jonathan Marbutt from the <a href="http://opus.codeplex.com/">Opus Silverlight framework</a>, and Jeff Weber from the <a href="http://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/">Farseer Physics Engine</a>. I also met lots of lovely people who were kind enough to throw some chips my way.</p>

<p>From the SO team I also acquired a black StackOverflow tee, which I am geeked out about.</p>

<p>I got a lot of awesome feedback on my little library, including plenty of questions about whether it works in Silverlight. Looks like I may have some investigating to do.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on the Keynote</h2>

<p><img src="http://desmond.yfrog.com/Himg620/scaled.php?tn=0&amp;server=620&amp;filename=zjpwp.jpg&amp;xsize=640&amp;ysize=640" alt="Keynote stage" /></p>

<p>I <a href="http://yfrog.com/h8zjpwpj">posted a picture</a> of what the MIX stage looked like at the keynote. It looked like a stage for a rock concert, it was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The content of the keynote seemed to generate mixed feelings. Several times the speaker had expected an eruption of applause but the audience wasn&rsquo;t forthcoming. Maybe they had all lost their money the night before?</p>

<p>The first half was all about IE and how it&rsquo;s so great and excellent and other browsers (<strong>Chrome</strong>) can&rsquo;t keep up. Personally, I like all the new improvements IE provided and hope to see other browsers play catch-up in terms of hardware acceleration. But the fact that only IE can perform hardware accelerated tasks sort of diminishes the value of the feature, since users not using IE9 (a <em>significant</em> portion of people) lose out. It&rsquo;s a value judgement you have to make (and in an ideal world, <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> have to make&hellip;). I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s any different than the decisions we&rsquo;ve had to make previously as designers about how to tackle issues that other browsers sans IE support, though.</p>

<p>Notably missing was talk about Silverlight. Microsoft seems to be undecided in what to sell&hellip; on one hand they are focusing hard on HTML5 and rich web experiences but on the other they are selling Windows Phone 7 which builds on Silverlight. The rest of the non-MS world has shown it is entirely behind HTML5, so at least on the web, I feel like Silverlight is a losing battle&hellip; not that SL is bad by any means, just that more tooling may come out surrounding HTML5 than SL.</p>

<p>I thought the keynote was &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s probably where I&rsquo;ll stick. I didn&rsquo;t expect half the time to be spent on IE but then I really didn&rsquo;t know what I should be expecting.</p>
